If not, where can I find it?\nThank you for viewing.\nNote: I am not expecting to find Fermat's handwritings  because they may not exist.\nI was hoping to find a proof that would look more ''Fermatian''.\n", "A": "Here is how Fermat probably did it (it is how I did it - not all of the steps were needed but I have to believe this was close to Fermat's thought process).\nAny prime of the form $8n+1$ or $8n+3$ can be written in the form $a^2 +2b^2$.  This is proved with descent techniques once realizes that $-2$ and $1$ are squares mod $8n+1$ or $8n+3$ and hence setting $a^2=-2$ and $b^2 = 1$ gets the result of $0$ (mod $8n+1$ or $8n+3$) for $a^2+2b^2$, which means our prime divides the result.\nAny prime of the form $8n+5$ or $8n+7$ cannot be.\nPoint two is that combinations of squares with common shapes when multiplied by each other retain their shape.  Let $x = a^2 + Sb^2$, and $y = c^2 + Sd^2$.\n$xy = (ac+Sbd)^2 + S(ad-bc)^2 = (ac-Sbd)^2 + S(ad+bc)^2$\nPoint three is that if $y$ is even $y^2 + 2$ is even as is $x^3$.  Dividing both sides by $2$ would make the left hand side odd and right hand side even so both $y$ and $x$ are odd.\nPoint four is that if a non-prime is of the form $a^2 + 2b^2$ then all its prime factors must be of the form $8n+1$ or $8n+3$, or the factor must be a square.\nPoint five is to observe that $y^2 + 2$ is of the form $a^2 + 2b^2$ with $a=y$ and $b=1$.  Combining this with four and one means there are no squares of the form $8n+5$ or $8n+7$ since $b$ would be equal to that square, not $1$.\nSo now we expand upon point three to make the proof.  $x$ is of the form $a^2 + 2b^2$.  $x^3$ can be written as $(a^3-3Sab^2)^2 + S(3a^2b-Sb^3)^2$.  Letting $S=2$ we see that the expression $(3a^2b-2b^3)^2$ must be equal to $1$.  Hence $b^2 \\cdot (3a^2-2b^2)^2 =1$.  Using positive integers we see  $b=a=1$ is the only solution.

This renders the matrix block diagonal of 2 blocks with size n-1 and 1. The first block is the the principal submatrix of the orignal matrix, and the second block is the element 1.
