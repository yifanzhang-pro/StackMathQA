{"Q": "Should normalisation factor in a QM always be positive? I have a fairly simple question about a normalisation factor. After normalising a wavefunction for a particle in an infinite square well on an interval $-L/2<x<L/2$ I got a quadratic equation for a normalisation factor $A_0$ which has a solution like this: \n$$A_0 = - \\frac{8\\pi}{6} \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{8^2\\pi^2}{36}+\\frac{3}{4}}$$\nThe sign $\\pm$ gives me two options while a normalisation factor can only be one value. So I want to know if there are any criteria on which i could decide which value to choose. Is it possible that normalisation factor should always be a positive value?\n\nI added the procedure I used to derive this eq. :\n\n", "A": "I think you made a mistake.\n\nUsing your wavefunction and noting that $$\\int^\\frac{L}{2}_{-\\frac{L}{2}}\n\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L}\\right) = \\frac{4L}{3\\pi}$$ we see that\n$$1=\\int^{L/2}_{-L/2}|\\psi(x)|^2 dx = \\frac{2}{L}\\left(|A_0|^2\\frac{L}{2} +\\frac{4L}{3\\pi}\n\\left(A_0 + A_0^*\\right)+ \\frac{1}{4}\\frac{L}{2}\\right) = \\left(|A_0|^2 +\\frac{8}{3\\pi}\n\\left(A_0 + A_0^*\\right)+ \\frac{1}{4}\\right)$$\nand so we have the constraint\n$$\\boxed{|A_0|^2 +\\frac{8}{3\\pi}\n\\left(A_0 + A_0^*\\right)+ \\frac{1}{4} = 1}$$\nIf we let $A_0 = a+ib$, with $a,b$ real, this reduces to\n$$a^2+b^2 +\\frac{16}{3\\pi}a\n+ \\frac{1}{4} = 1\n$$\nIf we make the choice that $A_0$ is real, that is $A_0 = a$ we find\n$$A_0^2 +\\frac{16}{3\\pi} A_0\n+ \\frac{1}{4} = 1 ~~\\implies ~~ \\boxed{A_0 = -\\frac{8}{3\\pi}\\pm\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{8}{3\\pi}\\right)^2+\\frac{3}{4}}}$$\nwhich is what I am guessing you were trying to get. We see that the most general solution involves both $a$ and $b$ - it is complex. To find a general result, parameterized by $a$ we solve \n$$a^2+b^2 +\\frac{16}{3\\pi}a\n+ \\frac{1}{4} = 1~~\\implies ~~ b = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4}-a^2-\\frac{16}{3\\pi}a}$$\nand so our general solution is\n$$\\boxed{A_0 = a \\pm i\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4}-a^2-\\frac{16}{3\\pi}a}}\n$$\n(note we must restrict $a$ to take values for which $\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4}-a^2-\\frac{16}{3\\pi}a}$ is real). So we have a range of possible solutions. I cannot see any way to make a choice of one solution over any other.\n\nAdded after comments below: \nIt is likely that the question (wherever you found it) has a typo and the interval of interest is actually $[0,L]$. This makes more sense, because the first two energy eigenstates of an infinite square well potential on the interval $[0,L]$ are (up to a normalization) $\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)$ and $\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L}\\right)$. Under this scenario, the problem of normalization is much simpler, because these two functions are orthogonal on this interval. This means that we have\n$$1 = \\int^L_0 dx |\\psi(x)|^2 = |A_0|^2 + \\frac{1}{4} \\implies |A_0| = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$$\nso we would have $A_0 = e^{i\\theta}\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ for arbitrary, real $\\theta$.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/73210", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "1", "answer_count": 2, "answer_id": 1}}

Therefore the measurement must result in one of the common eigenstates of $A$ and $B$. Now it turns out that $A$ and $B$ have an unique common set of eigenstates, which are just the basis states. Therefore the probabilities are just the diagonal elements of the density matrix, that is (naming $a$ the measurement result of $A$ and $b$ the measurement result of $B$):\n$$\\begin{aligned}\np(a=1 \\land b=3) &= \\frac{3}{14}\\\\\np(a=1 \\land b=4) &= \\frac{3}{14}\\\\\np(a=2 \\land b=3) &= 0\\\\\np(a=2 \\land b=4) &= \\frac{4}{7}\n\\end{aligned}$$\nNote that $p(a=2 \\land b=4) \\ne p(a=2)\\cdot p(b=4)$ since the events are not independent of each other. But that's not specifically quantum; if you know $a=2$, you already know that $b$ must be $4$, while from learning $a=1$ you don't learn anything about the measurement result $b$. Already classical probability theory tells you that in that case, the product formula for the probabilities doesn't hold.\nIndeed, given that there is a single combined measurement, you could split the measurement into two steps; first doing the measurement (which produces the values for $a$ and $b$), and then, reading the measurement results (which is a completely classical process, described by ordinary probability theory).\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/110059", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "3", "answer_count": 1, "answer_id": 0}}
