{"Q": "Is this Laurent phenomenon explained by invariance/periodicity?

Fix a positive integer $k\\geq 2$. Define a\nsequence $\\left( a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\\ldots \\right) $ of positive rational\nnumbers recursively by setting\n\\begin{align*}\na_{n}=1\\qquad \\text{for each }n<k\n\\end{align*}\nand\n\\begin{align*}\na_{n}=\\dfrac{a_{n-1}a_{n-2}+a_{n-2}a_{n-3}+\\cdots +a_{n-k+2}a_{n-k+1}}{\na_{n-k}}\\qquad \\text{for each }n\\geq k.\n\\end{align*}\n\nNote the difference between Sequences 2 and 3: The numerator in Sequence 2\nis $\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{\\left(k-1\\right)/2} a_{n-2i+1} a_{n-2i}$,\nwhereas the numerator in Sequence 3 is\n$\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{k-2} a_{n-i} a_{n-i-1}$.\nThus the requirement for $k$ to be odd in Sequence 2.\nNow, Gale claims that all three sequences have the integrality property:\ni.e., all their entries $a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\\ldots $ are integers (for all\npossible values of $k$). More interesting is the way he claims to prove\nthis: by constructing an auxiliary sequence that turns out to be constant or\nperiodic with a small period.\nUnfortunately, he only shows this for Sequence 1. Here, the auxiliary\nsequence is $\\left( b_{k},b_{k+1},b_{k+2},\\ldots \\right) $, defined by\nsetting\n\\begin{align*}\nb_{n}=\\dfrac{a_{n}+a_{n-k}}{a_{n-1}a_{n-2}\\cdots a_{n-k+1}}\\qquad \\text{for\neach }n\\geq k.\n\\end{align*}\nBy applying the recursion of Sequence 1 once to $n$ and once to $n-1$ and\nsubtracting, it is not hard to see that $b_{n}=b_{n-1}$ for each $n\\geq k+1$\n. Thus, the sequence $\\left( b_{k},b_{k+1},b_{k+2},\\ldots \\right) $ is\nconstant, and therefore all its entries $b_{n}$ are integers (since $b_{k}=k$\nis an integer). However, we can solve the equation $b_{n}=\\dfrac{\na_{n}+a_{n-k}}{a_{n-1}a_{n-2}\\cdots a_{n-k+1}}$ for $a_{n}$, obtaining $\na_{n}=b_{n}a_{n-1}a_{n-2}\\cdots a_{n-k+1}-a_{n-k}$, and this gives a new\nrecursive equation for the sequence $\\left( a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\\ldots \\right) \n$. This new recursive equation no longer involves division, and thus a\nstraightforward strong induction suffices to show that all $a_{n}$ are\nintegers (since all $b_{n}$ as well as the first $k$ entries $\na_{0},a_{1},\\ldots ,a_{k-1}$ of Sequence 1 are integers). The details of\nthis proof can be found in Gale's book or in the Notes on mathematical\nproblem solving I am currently writing for Math 235 at\nDrexel\n(Exercise 8.1.8).\nGale claims that similar arguments work for Sequences 2 and 3. And indeed,\nthis proof can be adapted to Sequence 2 rather easily, by redefining the\nauxiliary sequence to be a sequence $\\left( b_{k+1},b_{k+2},b_{k+3},\\ldots\n\\right) $ (starting at $b_{k+1}$ this time) defined by\n\\begin{align*}\nb_{n}=\\dfrac{a_{n}+a_{n-k-1}}{a_{n-2}a_{n-3}\\cdots a_{n-k+1}}\\qquad \\text{\nfor each }n\\geq k+1.\n\\end{align*}\nI am, however, struggling with adapting this line of reasoning to Sequence\n3. If $k$ is odd, then we can set\n\\begin{align*}\nb_{n}=\\dfrac{a_{n}+a_{n-k+1}}{a_{n-1}a_{n-3}\\cdots a_{n-k+2}}\\qquad \\text{\nfor each }n\\geq k-1\n\\end{align*}\n(where the denominator is $\\prod\\limits_{i=1}^{\\left( k-1\\right) /2}a_{n-2i+1}$).\nThe resulting sequence $\\left( b_{k-1},b_{k},b_{k+1},\\ldots \\right) $ is not\nconstant, but it is periodic with period $2$ (that is, $b_{n}=b_{n-2}$ for\neach $n\\geq k+1$); this is still sufficient for our argument. However, this\nonly applies to the case when $k$ is odd. (I have found this definition of $\nb_{n}$ in Section 7.5 of Joshua Alman, Cesar Cuenca, Jiaoyang Huang,\nLaurent phenomenon sequences, J. Algebr. Comb. (2016)\n43:589--633, which studies a\nmore general recursion.)\nWhen $k$ is even, I see no such proof. I assume that the integrality of $\na_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\\ldots $ follows from the standard Laurent phenomenon\nresults known nowadays (by Fomin, Zelevinsky, Lam, Pylyavskyy and others). I haven't properly\nchecked it, as there are a few technical conditions too many, but it is\ncertainly consistent with SageMath\nexperiments. Alman/Cuenca/Huang do not seem to consider the\n$k$-even case in their paper.\n\nQuestion. Can we prove using the above tools that the\nentries $a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\\ldots $ of Sequence 3 are integers?\n\n", "A": "Yes, we can. The argument for odd $k$ made in the Alman/Cuenca/Huang paper was a red herring. We can argue for arbitrary $k \\geq 2$ as follows:\nLet $n \\geq k+2$.

Thus we obtain\n\\begin{align*}\n&a_{n} a_{n-k} + a_{n-k+1}a_{n-k} + a_{n-k}a_{n-k-1} + a_{n-2} a_{n-k} \\\\\n&= a_{n-1}a_{n-2}+a_{n-2}a_{n-3} + a_{n-2} a_{n-k-2} + a_{n-2} a_{n-k} .\n\\end{align*}\nBoth sides of this equality can be easily factored, so the equality rewrites as\n\\begin{align*}\n&a_{n-k} \\left(a_{n} + a_{n-2} + a_{n-k+1} + a_{n-k-1} \\right) \\\\\n&= a_{n-2} \\left(a_{n-1} + a_{n-3} + a_{n-k} + a_{n-k-2} \\right).\n\\end{align*}\nDividing this equality by $a_{n-2} a_{n-3} \\cdots a_{n-k}$, we obtain\n\\begin{align*}\n\\dfrac{a_{n} + a_{n-2} + a_{n-k+1} + a_{n-k-1}}{a_{n-2}a_{n-3}\\cdots a_{n-k+1}}\n&= \\dfrac{a_{n-1} + a_{n-3} + a_{n-k} + a_{n-k-2}}{a_{n-3}a_{n-4}\\cdots a_{n-k}} .\n\\end{align*}\nIn other words, $b_n = b_{n-1}$, where we define a sequence $\\left(b_{k+1}, b_{k+2}, b_{k+3}, \\ldots\\right)$ of rational numbers by setting $b_m = \\dfrac{a_m + a_{m-2} + a_{m-k+1} + a_{m-k-1}}{a_{m-2}a_{m-3}\\cdots a_{m-k+1}}$ for each $m \\geq k+1$. Thus, this sequence $\\left(b_{k+1}, b_{k+2}, b_{k+3}, \\ldots\\right)$ is constant (since we have shown that $b_n = b_{n-1}$ for each $n \\geq k+2$). Hence, all entries $b_m$ of this sequence are integers (since it is easily seen that $b_{k+1}$ is an integer).\nNow, we can solve the equality $b_m = \\dfrac{a_m + a_{m-2} + a_{m-k+1} + a_{m-k-1}}{a_{m-2}a_{m-3}\\cdots a_{m-k+1}}$ for $a_m$, obtaining\n\\begin{align*}\na_m = b_m a_{m-2}a_{m-3}\\cdots a_{m-k+1} - \\left(a_{m-2} + a_{m-k+1} + a_{m-k-1}\\right)\n\\end{align*}\nfor each $m \\geq k+1$. This easily yields (by strong induction on $m$) that all of $a_0, a_1, a_2, \\ldots$ are integers (after you check manually that $a_0, a_1, \\ldots, a_k$ are integers).\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://mathoverflow.net/questions/378121", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "6", "answer_count": 1, "answer_id": 0}}
{"Q": "Are all integers not congruent to 6 modulo 9 of the form $x^3+y^3+3z^2$? Are all integers not congruent to 6 modulo 9 of the form $x^3+y^3+3z^2$\nfor possibly negative integers $x,y,z$?\nWe have the identity $ (-t)^3+(t-1)^3+3 t^2=3t-1$.\nThe only congruence obstruction we found is 6 modulo 9.\n", "A": "We can also say the each $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ with $n \\equiv 3 \\pmod 9$ is representable as $x^3 + y^3 + 3z^2$. This is because\n$$(-t)^3 + (t-9)^3 + 3(3t -13)^2 = 9t - 222$$\nand $-222 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 9$.\nSo, along with the identity in the question we can represent each integer congruent to $2$, $3$, $5$, or $8 \\pmod 9$. This leaves only $0$, $1$, $4$, and $7 \\pmod 9$.\nMore generally we have\n$$(-t)^3 + (t - a^2)^3 + 3(at - b)^2 = 3a(a^3 - 2b)t + 3b^2 - a^6$$\nwhich is congruent to $-a^6 \\pmod 3$. This is either $0$ or $-1 \\pmod 3$ depending on if $3$ divides $a$ or not. Taking $a = 3$ and $b = 13$ we obtain the first equation which takes care of $n \\equiv 3 \\pmod 9$. If we take $a = 3$ and $b = 12$ we get $27t - 297$.\nThis gives us $n \\equiv 0 \\equiv -297 \\pmod{27}$ which is some further progress. Hence, $0 \\pmod 9$ can be resolved by finding $9 \\pmod {27}$ and $18 \\pmod{27}$.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://mathoverflow.net/questions/378968", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "10", "answer_count": 3, "answer_id": 0}}
