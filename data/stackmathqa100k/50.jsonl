Cassels, presented in the International Congress in Singapore in 1981, the article is pages 9-26 in the book. Below is page 18, then page 19.\nWatson 1955 is Representations of integers by indefinite quadratic forms, Mathematika, volume 2, pages 32-38.

The main lemma from binary forms is that, given a (positive) prime $q \\equiv \\pm 3 \\pmod 8,$ if $q | (a^2 - 2 b^2),$ then $q|a,b,$ and in fact $q^2 | (a^2-2 b^2).$ By induction there is some $l$ such that $q^{2l} \\parallel (a^2 - 2 b^2).$ The double vertical bar means that we are showing the highest exponent of the prime such that the indicated power still divides the expression on the other side. \nNow, suppose we have some $t$ such that all (positive) prime factors $p$ of $t$ satisfy $p \\equiv \\pm 1 \\pmod 8.$ We will prove that $(2x+z)^2 - 2 y^2 + 16 z^2 \\neq t^2. $ For, if we had $(2x+z)^2 - 2 y^2 + 16 z^2 = t^2, $ we would need to have odd $z$ because $t$ is odd. Next $$(2x+z)^2 - 2 y^2 = t^2 - 16 z^2 = (t+4z)(t-4z).  $$\nBoth $t+4z, \\; t- 4 z \\equiv \\pm 3 \\pmod 8$  because $z$ is odd. There is some (positive) prime $q \\equiv \\pm 3 \\pmod 8$ with $q^{2j+1} \\parallel t+4z.$ However, from the earlier lemma, as $q^{2l} \\parallel ( (2x+z)^2 - 2 y^2),$ we find that $q^{2k+1} \\parallel (t-4z).$ That is, $q | t+4z$ and $q | t - 4 z,$ so that $q | t,$ which contradicts the hypotheses on $t.$ \nTo show explicitly that Siegel's second form does represent all $q^2,$ for prime $q \\equiv \\pm 3 \\pmod 8.$ \nStart with\n$$  \\left( \\alpha^2 - 2 \\beta^2 + 4 \\gamma^2 \\right)^2 =  \\left( \\alpha^2 + 2 \\beta^2 - 4 \\gamma^2 \\right)^2 - 2  \\left( 2 \\alpha \\beta  \\right)^2 + 4  \\left( 2 \\alpha \\gamma  \\right)^2$$\nFor $q \\equiv  3 \\pmod 8,$ we may take $\\gamma = \\beta, \\; \\;  q = \\alpha^2 + 2 \\beta^2$ with both $\\alpha,\\beta$ odd, then\n$$ q^2 = \\left( \\alpha^2 - 2 \\beta^2  \\right)^2 - 2  \\left( 2 \\alpha \\beta  \\right)^2 + 16  \\left(  \\alpha \\beta  \\right)^2 $$ with\nboth $\\alpha^2 - 2 \\beta^2$ and $ \\alpha \\beta$ odd. So, we have written $$ q^2 = \\zeta^2 - 2 \\eta^2 + 16 \\theta^2, \\; \\; \\zeta \\equiv \\theta \\pmod 2.  $$\nFor $q \\equiv  5 \\pmod 8,$ we may take $ \\beta = 0, \\; \\;  q = \\alpha^2 + 4 \\gamma^2$ with both $\\alpha,\\gamma$ odd, then\n$$ q^2 = \\left( \\alpha^2 - 4 \\gamma^2  \\right)^2 - 2  \\left( 0  \\right)^2 + 16  \\left(  \\alpha \\gamma  \\right)^2 $$ with\nboth $\\alpha^2 - 4 \\gamma^2$ and $ \\alpha \\gamma$ odd.

{"Q": "A Problem Concerning Odd Perfect Number Briefly, prove that every odd number having only three distinct prime factors cannot be a perfect number.\nI know there are results much stronger than the one above, but I am looking for an answer without computer cracking (which means the computation can be carried out by a person), thanks.\n", "A": "Here is a proof, perhaps not the simplest. Let $n$ be an odd perfect number with three distinct prime factors. As observed in the comments, $n$ is of the form $3^a5^bp^c$, where $p\\in\\{7,11,13\\}$.\nIt is a simple fact (observed by Euler) that exactly one of the exponents $a$, $b$, $c$ is odd. Let $q^r\\parallel n$ be the corresponding prime power (i.e. $r$ is odd), then $q+1$ divides $\\sigma(q^r)$, hence also $\\sigma(n)=2n$. Therefore $(q+1)/2$ divides $n/q^r$, which forces $q\\not\\in\\{3,7,11,13\\}$, i.e. $q=5$. Hence $b$ is odd, while $a$ and $c$ are even. Now we can rewrite the equation $\\sigma(n)=2n$ as\n$$ 3^{a-1}5^bp^c=(1+3+\\dots + 3^a)(1+5^2+\\dots + 5^{b-1})(1+p+\\dots+p^c),$$\nwhere the middle sum on the right hand sum only contains even powers of $5$.

{"Q": "Failing of heuristics from circle method The heuristic from circle method for integral points on diagonal cubic surfaces $x^3+y^3+z^3=a$ ($a$ is a cubic-free integer) seems to fit well with numerical computations by ANDREAS-STEPHAN ELSENHANS AND JORG JAHNEL. The only known exception is the surface $x^3+y^3+z^3=2$. Circle method predicts that the number of integral points $(x,y,z)$ with $\\max(\\vert x\\vert,\\vert y \\vert,\\vert z\\vert)<N$ is $\\approx 0.16\\log N$. But parametric solutions $(1+6t^3,1-6t^3,-6t^2)$ are missing.\nQuestion: Why the heuristic fails for $x^3+y^3+z^3=2$? \n", "A": "Note as a caveat that the heuristics can fail in the other direction as well: Dietmann and Elsholtz ( http://www.math.tugraz.at/~elsholtz/WWW/papers/papers26de08.pdf ) have shown that if $p\\equiv 7\\pmod{8}$ is prime, then $p^2$ cannot be represented as $x^2+y^2+z^4$. This strongly contradicts the heuristic of the circle method, since $\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{4}>1$ should imply that every sufficiently large integer $n$ is either representable as $n=x^2+y^2+z^4$, or there is some local constraint, i.e. a modulus $q$ such that $n\\equiv x^2+y^2+z^4\\pmod{q}$ is unsolvable.\nThis theorem is one of those cases where formulating the theorem is much more difficult than proving it. Write $x^2+y^2+z^4=p^2$ as $x^2+y^2=(p-z^2)(p+z^2)$. Now $p-z^2$ is $3\\pmod{4}$ or $6\\pmod{8}$, hence divisible by some prime $q\\equiv 3\\pmod{4}$ to the first power. But a sum of two squares cannot be divisible by such a prime with odd exponent, thus $q$ divides $p+z^2$ as well. Now $q|(p-z^2, p+z^2)$, thus $q$ divides $2p$ and $2z^2$, hence $p=q$ and $p|z$.

We want to rule out finding distinct $a,b,c,d$ in short interval (specifically $[n^2+1,n^2+2n]$) with $ad=bc.$ We may assume that $a$ is the smallest and that $b<c$. Then $a<b<c<d.$ I will show that $a+2\\sqrt{a}+1\\leq d$ so that if $n^2 \\leq a$ then $(n+1)^2 \\leq d.$\nClaim:  There are integers $u<v$ and $x<y$ with $$a,b,c,d=ux,uy,vx,vy.$$\nProof: Let $u=\\gcd(a,b)$ so $a=ux$ and $b=uy$ with $\\gcd(x,y)=1.$ Then $uxd=uyc$ so $xd=yc$ and thus (since $x$ and $y$ are co-prime) there is $v$ with $c=xv$ and $d=yv.$\nASIDE We might as well use $v=u+1$ and $y=x+1$ since $$a,b',c',d'=ux,u(x+1),(u+1)x,(u+1)(x+1)$$ give $ad'=b'c'$  with $a <b',c',d'\\leq d.$ I'll comment a bit more about this at the end.\nSo we want to show \n\nif $ad=bc$ with $n^2<a<b<c<d$ then $d>(n+1)^2.$ \n\nFrom the claim above, $n^2<a=ux$ and $d\\geq (u+1)(x+1)=ux+u+x+1.$ But given $ux=a>n^2,$ we know $u+x\\geq 2\\sqrt{a}>2n.$ Thus $ux+u+x+1>n^2+2n+1$ as desired.\n\nConsider this problem: Given $a$, find $a<b<c<d$ with $d$ minimal such that $ad=bc.$ The work above shows that the solution is to have $$a,b,c,d=ux,u(x+1),(u+1)x,(u+1)(x+1)$$ with $|u-x|$ minimal and that $d>a+2\\sqrt{a}+1.$ If we allow $b=c$ then $$n^2\\cdot (n+1)^2=(n^2+n)\\cdot (n^2+n).$$ If we want $b < c$ then $(n^2-n)\\cdot(n^2+n)=(n^2-1)\\cdot(n^2).$ With $d-a\\approx 2\\sqrt{a}.$\n\nIf $ad=bc$ then $abcd$ is a perfect square.
