First, assume that $a, b$ are relatively prime (dividing through by the gcd divides the lhs by a square).

Since, $a, b$ are two sides of a pythagorean triangle, one is even, the other is odd, so the expression within the last paren is odd, but twice an odd number is not a square.\nUPDATE in the case, $a, b$ are both odd, $2(a^2 + b^2)$ is divisible by $4,$ but the expression in the last paren is $3$ mod $4,$ so again, not a square.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://mathoverflow.net/questions/265786", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "3", "answer_count": 1, "answer_id": 0}}

If $v \\leq 0$, then $f$ has a nonnegative real root, which is impossible because $f$ has non-negative coefficients and $f(0) > 0$. Thus, $v > 0$, and therefore $g(1) \\geq 2$, forcing $g(1) = p$ and $h(1) = 1$. By symmetry, this rules out the case $\\deg h = 1$. Thus, we may assume $\\alpha > 0$.

Thus, we only have to consider $x = \\tfrac{-\\beta}{\\alpha} \\in (0,1]$. For $x < 1$, we must have $\\alpha \\geq 2$, so $(1-x+x^2)\\alpha \\geq \\tfrac{3}{2} > 1$. Finally, for $x = 1$, i.e. $\\beta = -\\alpha$, \\eqref{2} shows that $v \\geq u$. Since $p = v+u$ is odd, we must have $v > u$, so \\eqref{2} gives $\\gamma > -\\beta$, so $h(1) = \\gamma \\geq 2$.\nThus, we conclude that $\\deg g = 0$ or $\\deg h = 0$; say $g = n$ for $n \\in \\mathbf Z_{>0}$ without loss of generality. If $n > 1$, then $n = p$, which is impossible since $f(0) = d \\in \\{1, \\ldots, p-1\\}$ is not divisible by $p$. So we conclude that $g = 1$. $\\square$\nRemark. The argument above relies crucially on the assumption $\\deg f \\leq 3$.

{"Q": "On Markoff-type diophantine equation Do there exist integers $x,y,z$ such that\n$$\nx^2+y^2-z^2 = xyz -2 \\quad ?\n$$\nWhy this is interesting? First, this equation arose in an answer to the previous Mathoverflow question What is the smallest unsolved diophantine equation? but was not asked explicitly as a separate question. The context is that, in a well-defined sense for the notion of \"smallness\", the equation above is the \"smallest\" open Diophantine equation.\nSecond, this equation is one of the simplest non-trivial representative of the family of equations $ax^2+by^2+cz^2=dxyz+e$, which generalises a well-known Markoff equation $x^2+y^2+z^2=3xyz$. The well-known methods for the former (Vieta jumping) has been extended to the general case if $a,b,c$ are all natural numbers and are divisors of $d$ (see, for example, Fine, Benjamin, et al. \"On the Generalized Hurwitz Equation and the Baragar\u2013Umeda Equation.\" Results in Mathematics 69.1-2 (2016): 69-92). The question seems to be much more challenging when $a,b,c$ have different signs. The simplest case with different signs is $a=b=d=1$ and $c=-1$, which leads to the family of equations $x^2+y^2-z^2=xyz+e$. The equation above is the first non-trivial example from this family.\n", "A": "There is no solution.\nFix a solution $(x,y,z)$ with $|x|+|y|+|z|$ minimal. We will show a contradiction.\nWe can't have $xyz=0$ as we would then obtain one of the unsolvable equations $x^2+y^2= -2$,  $x^2-z^2=-2$, $y^2-z^2=-2$.\nIf $xyz>0$, then by swapping the signs of two of $x,y,z$ if necessary we can assume $x,y,z>0$, and switching $x$ and $y$ we can assume $x \\geq y$. We have the Vieta jump $x \\to yz-x$, so if this is minimal we have $x \\leq yz/2$. Since $f(x)=x^2+y^2-z^2 - xyz + 2 $ is convex and vanishes at $x$, we must $f(y) \\geq 0$ or $f(yz/2) \\geq 0$.\nBut $$f(y)= (2-z)y^2 -z^2 + 2$$ so $f(y) \\leq 0$ imply $z<2$ and $z=1$ gives the impossible $x^2+y^2-xy=-1$ and $$f(yz/2) =  y^2 -z^2 - y^2 z^2/4 +1= (1-z^2/4)y^2 - z^2 +1$$ which again is nonnegative only if $z<2$ which is impossible.\nIf$xyz<0$, then by swapping the signs if necessary we can assume $x,y,z<0$.  We have the Vieta jump $z \\to -xy-z$, so if this is minimal we have $z \\geq -xy/2$. We have $g(z)=z^2 + xyz - x^2-y^2-2$ is convex and vanishes at $z$, we must have $g(0) \\geq 0$ or $g(-xy/2) \\geq 0$.\nBut $g(0) = -x^2 - y^2 - 2 <0$  and $g(-xy/2) = - x^2 y^2/4 - x^2 - y^2 -2 <0$.\nSo neither case is possible.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://mathoverflow.net/questions/392993", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "7", "answer_count": 1, "answer_id": 0}}

Consider the following polynomial:\n$$p_{n,j}(x)=\\frac{\\prod\\limits_{i=1}^{n+1}\\frac{x^{i}+1}{x+1}}{\\prod\\limits_{i=1}^{j}\\frac{x^{i}+1}{x+1}\\prod\\limits_{i=1}^{n-j+1}\\frac{x^{i}+1}{x+1}}\\in\\mathbb{F}[x]$$\nThis polynomial can be computed for each $j,n$ given. What I want to do is to understand in which cases $p(1)=0$ and in which cases $p(1)=1$ when working over a field $\\mathbb{F}$ of characteristic $2$. I checked some cases by hand and this is what I got:\n$$p_{2,1}(1)=p_{2,2}(1)=1$$\n$$p_{3,1}(1)=p_{3,2}(1)=p_{3,3}(1)=0$$\n$$p_{4,1}(1)=p_{4,4}(1)=1~~p_{4,2}(1)=p_{4,3}(1)=0$$\n$$p_{5,2}(1)=p_{5,4}(1)=1~~p_{5,1}(1)=p_{5,3}(1)=p_{5,5}=0$$\n$$p_{6,1}(1)=p_{6,2}(1)=p_{6,3}(1)=p_{6,4}(1)=p_{6,5}(1)=p_{6,6}(1)=1$$\nSo apparently there is no easy pattern.  It is also easily expressible as a product of cyclotomic polynomials, but I'm not sure if this is of any help. I would like (if possible) to have a way to know if $p_{n,j}(1)=0$ or $p_{n,j}(1)=1$ just in terms of $n$ and $j$.\nIf you are courious, these are the coefficients that has appeared in the computation of the homology groups of a certain family of Artin groups. I want to understand the behaviour of these polynomials over a field of characteristic $2$ in $x=1$ because this is the situation where I can assure that the homology groups are infinite dimensional.\nThanks for your help.\n", "A": "Claim: $p_{n,j}(1)$ vanishes modulo $2$ if and only there is a carry when adding $j$ and $n+1-j$ in base-$2$.\nProof: Let us write $x^n+1 \\equiv x^n-1= \\prod_{d \\mid n} \\Phi_d(x)$ where $\\Phi_d$ is the $d$th cyclotomic polynomial. Then, since there are $\\lfloor m/d\\rfloor$ multiplies of $d$ in $\\{1,2,\\ldots,m\\}$,\n$$p_{n,j}(x) = \\prod_{d=2}^{n} \\Phi_d(x)^{\\lfloor \\frac{n+1}{d} \\rfloor- \\lfloor \\frac{j}{d}\\rfloor - \\lfloor \\frac{n-j+1}{d}\\rfloor }.$$\nNote that $\\lfloor a+b \\rfloor \\ge \\lfloor a\\rfloor + \\lfloor b \\rfloor$ so your expression is necessarily a polynomial (and not a strictly rational function).\nThe value of $\\Phi_d(x)$ at $x=1$ is well-understood. One can use the property $x^n-1= \\prod_{d \\mid n} \\Phi_d(x)$ to show $\\Phi_d(1)$ is $1$ unless $d$ is a prime power $p^k$ in which case $\\Phi_d(1)=p$ (this is classical, see here for proofs). This implies\n$$p_{n,j}(1) \\equiv \\prod_{p^k \\le n} p^{\\lfloor \\frac{n+1}{p^k} \\rfloor- \\lfloor \\frac{j}{p^k}\\rfloor - \\lfloor \\frac{n-j+1}{p^k}\\rfloor }.$$\nSince $2$ is the only even prime,\n$$p_{n,j}(1) \\equiv \\prod_{2^k \\le n} 2^{\\lfloor \\frac{n+1}{2^k} \\rfloor- \\lfloor \\frac{j}{2^k}\\rfloor - \\lfloor \\frac{n-j+1}{2^k}\\rfloor }.$$\nSo your expression vanishes modulo $2$ if and only if\n$$ \\sum_{2 \\le 2^k \\le n} \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n+1}{2^k} \\right\\rfloor- \\left\\lfloor \\frac{j}{2^k}\\right\\rfloor- \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n-j+1}{2^k}\\right\\rfloor\\ge 1.$$\nLet us express this criterion using base-$2$ representation. If $j = \\sum_{i \\ge 0} a_i 2^i$, $n-j+1 = \\sum_{i \\ge 0} b_i 2^i$ and $n+1 = \\sum_{i \\ge 0} c_i 2^i$ then\n$$ \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n+1}{2^k} \\right\\rfloor- \\left\\lfloor \\frac{j}{2^k}\\right\\rfloor- \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n-j+1}{2^k}\\right\\rfloor =\\sum_{i \\ge k} (c_i-a_i-b_i) 2^{i-k} $$\nso that\n$$\\begin{align} \n\\sum_{2 \\le 2^k \\le n} \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n+1}{2^k} \\right\\rfloor- \\left\\lfloor \\frac{j}{2^k}\\right\\rfloor- \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n-j+1}{2^k}\\right\\rfloor &= \\sum_{i \\ge 0} (c_i-a_i-b_i)(2^{i-1}+2^{i-2}+\\ldots+1) \\\\\n&= \\sum_{i \\ge 0} (c_i-a_i-b_i)(2^{i}-1)\\\\\n&= n+1 - (j + (n+1-j)) - \\sum_{i \\ge 0} (c_i-a_i-b_i)\\\\\n&= \\sum_{i \\ge 0} (a_i+b_i-c_i).\n\\end{align}$$\nLet $s_2(m)$ be the sum of digits of $m$ in base-$2$. We see that $p_{n,j}(1)\\equiv 0$ if and only if $s_2(j) + s_2(n+1-j) > s_2(n+1)$.\nIn general, $s_2(a)+s_2(b)-s_2(a+b)$ is the number of carries when adding $a$ and $b$ in base-$2$ (can be proved by induction, goes back to Kummer).\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://mathoverflow.net/questions/438793", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "3", "answer_count": 2, "answer_id": 0}}
