Therefore the roots of $p$ must be five of the eleventh roots of unity which aren't equal to one,  and the roots of $q$ must be the other five. \nBut the coefficients of $p$ and $q$ are real, which means that their roots must occur in complex conjugate pairs.  So $p$ and $q$ must have even degree!  Since five is not even, this is impossible.\n(This proof would work if you replace six-sided dice with any even-sided dice.

{"Q": "Solving the quartic equation $r^4 + 4r^3s - 6r^2s^2 - 4rs^3 + s^4 = 1$ I'm working on solving the quartic Diophantine equation in the title.

As the fundamental solution in this case is $(r^2+2rs-s^2,2rs)$, whereas the largest integer solution is $(r,s)$, perhaps there's a way of using that to force some sort of descent or contradiction?\nEDIT: Adding $4r^4$ and $4s^4$ to both sides of the equation and factoring yields, respectively\n\\begin{align*}\n (r-s)^2(r+s)(r+5s) &= (2s^2-2s+1)(2s^2+2s+1)\n\\end{align*}\nand\n\\begin{align*}\n (r-s)(r+s)^2(5r-s) &= (2r^2-2r+1)(2r^2+2r+1)\n\\end{align*}\nNote that, in each case, the two factors on the right-hand side are relatively prime (because they're odd, and evidently $\\gcd(r,s)=1$).

{"Q": "A surprising conjecture about twin primes Just for fun, I began to play with numbers of two distinct ciphers.

Obviously this is not always the case, because one can take non-coprime ciphers, however I realized that, for $0 \\le a<b \\le 9$, the quantity $$\\gcd (10a+b, 10b+a)$$ is never too big. Using brute force I computed\n$$\\max \\{ \\gcd (10a+b, 10b+a) : 0 \\le a<b \\le 9\\} = \\gcd (48,84)=12$$\nAfter that, I passed to an arbitrary base $n \\ge 2$, and considered\n$$f(n)= \\max \\{ \\gcd (an+b, bn+a) : 0 \\le a<b \\le n-1 \\}$$\nFor example $f(2)=1$ and $f(3)=2$.\nConsidering $n \\ge 4$,\nI noticed that, picking $a=2, b=n-3$ we have\n$$2n+(n-3) = 3(n-1)$$\n$$(n-3)n+2 = (n-2)(n-1)$$\nso that $f(n)$ has a trivial lower bound\n$$(n-1) \\le \\gcd (2n+(n-3), (n-3)n+2) \\le f(n) $$\n(which holds for $n=2,3$ as well).\nA second remark is\n$$\\gcd (0n+b, bn+0) = b \\le n-1$$\nso that we can restrict ourselves to the case $a \\neq 0$: in other words\n$$f(n)=\\max \\{ \\gcd (an+b, bn+a) : 1 \\le a<b \\le n-1 \\}$$\nI wrote a very simple program which computes the value of $f(n)$ for $n \\le 400$, selecting those numbers such that $f(n)=n-1$. Surprisingly, I found out that many numbers appeared:\n$$4, 6, 12, 18, 30, 42, 60, 72, 102, 108, 138, 150, 180, 192, 198, 228, 240, 270, 282, 312, 348$$\nMore surprisingly these turned out to be the numbers between couples of twin primes!\nWhat is going on here? \n", "A": "Suppose $n-1$ and $n+1$ are both primes.\n$\\gcd(an+b,bn+a)$ divides $an+b - (bn+a) = (a-b)(n-1)$.\nThere are two cases. If $n-1$ divides $\\gcd(an+b,bn+a)$ then $b=n-1-a$ so $an+b= (n-1) (a+1)$ and $bn+a=(n-1)(b+1)$, so $\\gcd(an+b,bn+a) = (n-1)\\gcd(a+1,b+1)$.\n$(a+1)+(b+1)=n+1$. Because $n+1$ is prime, two numbers that sum to it must be relatively prime (any common prime factor would be a prime factor of $n+1$, so woul be $n+1$, but $a+1$ and $b+1$ are both less than $n+1$.) So in this case $\\gcd(an+b,bn+a) = n-1$.\nOn the other hand, because $n-1$ is prime, if $n-1$ does not divide $\\gcd(an+b,bn+a)$ then $\\gcd(an+b,bn+a)$ divides $a-b$ and so is at most $n-2$.\nSo in this case the maximum value is $n-1$, attained whenever $a+b=n-1$.\nIf $n+1$ is not prime you can get greater than $n-1$ in the first case by taking a prime $\\ell$ dividing $n+1$, setting $a=\\ell-1$, $b=n-\\ell$ for a gcd of $\\ell (n-1)$.\nIf $n-1$ is not prime but instead $n-1= cd$ with $c \\leq d$, you can set $a=d+1$, $b=(c-1)(d+1) \\leq cd <n$ so that $an+b= (d+1) (cd+1) + (c-1)(d+1) = c d^2 +2cd + c= c(d+1)^2$ and $(b-a)(n-1)=(c-2) (d+1) cd$ are both divisible by $c (d+1) > n-1$, so the gcd is divisible by $c(d+1)$ and hence greater than $n-1$.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://mathoverflow.net/questions/257822", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "26", "answer_count": 1, "answer_id": 0}}

{"Q": "Three squares in a rectangle One of my colleagues gave me the following problem about 15 years ago:\nGiven three squares inside a 1 by 2 rectangle, with no two squares overlapping, prove that the sum of side lengths is at most 2. (The sides of the squares and the rectangle need not be parallel to each other.)\nI couldn't find a solution or even a source for this problem. Does anyone know about it? I was told that this was like an exercise in combinatorial geometry for high school contests such as IMO, but I'm not sure if this problem was listed in such competitions. Has anyone heard of this problem, or does anyone know how to solve it?\nAny kind of help will be appreciated.\n", "A": "Since the squares are convex, we can draw lines which separate them. In particular, if two separating lines go from $(b-a,0)$ to $(b,1)$ and from $(c,1)$ to $(c+d,0)$, then we can prove the result in terms of those lines and those variables.\nSo: let the rectangle go from $(0,0)$ to $(2,1)$. Let $A$ be the leftmost square (or one such square). Let $C$ be the rightmost square (or one such square). Let $B$ be the other square.\nDraw a line separating $A$ and $B$, and let $(b,1)$ and $(b-a,0)$ be its intersections with the lines $y=1$ and $y=0$.\nDraw a line separating $B$ and $C$, and let $(c,1)$ and $(c+d,0)$ be its intersections with the lines $y=1$ and $y=0$.\nReasoning as in user21820's answer, we assume wlog that:\n\n*\n\n*$0<a$, so $A$ is left and above the line separating $A$ and $B$;\n\n*$0<d$, so $C$ is right and above the line separating $B$ and $C$;\n\n*$0<b$ and $c<2$ and $a-b+c+d>0$, so $B$ is below both lines.\n\n(Since the lines may leave the rectangle, we do not assume $b-a>0$ or $b<2$ or $c>0$ or $c+d<2$.)\nLemma (proved at the end):\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{sidelength of }A &\\le \\min\\!\\left(\\frac{b}{a+1},\\,1\\right)\\\\\n\\text{sidelength of }B &\\le \\min\\!\\left((a-b+c+d)u,\\,1\\right)\\\\\n\\text{sidelength of }C &\\le \\min\\!\\left(\\frac{2-c}{d+1},\\,1\\right)\n\\end{align}\nwhere\n$$u=\\max\\left(\n\\frac{1}{a+d+1},\n\\frac{\\sqrt{a^2+1}}{a^2+a+d+1},\n\\frac{\\sqrt{d^2+1}}{d^2+d+a+1}\n\\right)$$\nThe factor $u$ satisfies $1/(a+1)>u$ and $1/(d+1)>u$ so long as $a<3.66$ and $d<3.66$ respectively. I will assume those inequalities for now to show that some functions are increasing or decreasing; I don't have a clean proof for those inequalities or without them yet.\nIn the corner case of $b=a+1$ and $c=1-d$, the side lengths are $1$, $0$ and $1$, and they sum to exactly $2$. We now use this in analyzing four cases.\nCase I, $b\\le a+1$ and $c\\le 1-d$: The sum of the sidelengths is at most\n$$\\frac{b}{a+1}+(a-b+c+d)u+1$$ This is increasing in both $b$ and $c$, so its value is at most the corner value of $2$.\nCase II, $b\\le a+1$ and $c\\ge 1-d$: The sum of the sidelengths is at most\n$$\\frac{b}{a+1}+(a-b+c+d)u+\\frac{2-c}{d+1}$$ This is increasing in $b$ and decreasing in $c$, so its value is at most the corner value of $2$.\nCase III, $b\\ge a+1$ and $c\\le 1-d$: The sum of the sidelengths is at most\n$$1+(a-b+c+d)u+1$$\nThis is decreasing in $b$ and increasing in $c$, so its value is at most the corner value of $2$.\nCase IV, $b\\ge a+1$ and $c\\ge 1-d$: The sum of the sidelengths is at most\n$$1+(a-b+c+d)u+\\frac{2-c}{d+1}$$\nThis is decreasing in both $b$ and $c$, so its value is at most the corner value of $2$.\nSo the sum of the sidelengths is at most $2$ in each case.\nProof of Lemma:\nThe sidelength of $A$ is clearly less than 1, and also clearly less than the maximum sidelength inscribed in the right triangle bounded by $x=0$, $y=1$, and the separator of $A$ and $B$. We use Polya's formula here to calculate the sidelength in the triangle as the maximum of $b/(a+1)$ and $b\\sqrt{a^2+1}/(a^2+a+1)$; since $a>0$, the maximum is just $b/(a+1)$.\nA similar use of Polya's result bounds the sidelength of $C$. Yet another use of that result, now for a triangle which may be acute or obtuse, bounds the sidelength of $B$ by $|a-b+c+d|u$. Since we assumed $a-b+c+d>0$, we write this bound as $(a-b+c+d)u$.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://mathoverflow.net/questions/396776", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "15", "answer_count": 2, "answer_id": 0}}
