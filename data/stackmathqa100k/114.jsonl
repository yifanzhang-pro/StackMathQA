{"Q": "Contradiction between Force and Torque equations A thin uniform rod of mass $M$ and length $L$ and cross-sectional area $A$, is free to rotate about a horizontal axis passing through one of its ends (see figure).\n\nWhat is the value of shear stress developed at the centre of the rod, immediately after its release from the horizontal position shown in the figure?\nFirstly, we can find the angular acceleration $\\alpha$ of the rod by applying the Torque equation about hinge point A as follows:\n$$ \\frac{MgL}{2} = \\frac{ML^2}{3} \\alpha$$\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{3g}{2L}$$\nSo the acceleration of the centre of the rod equals $\\alpha \\cdot \\frac{L}{2} = \\frac{3g}{4}$, Hence the hinge force $F_H = \\frac{Mg}{4}$\nNow consider an imaginary cut at the centre of the rod, dividing it into two halves.
