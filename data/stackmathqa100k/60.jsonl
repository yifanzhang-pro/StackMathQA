{"Q": "Equality of the sum of powers Hi everyone, I got a problem when proving lemmas for some combinatorial problems,\nand it is a question about integers.\nLet \n$\\sum_{k=1}^m a_k^t = \\sum_{k=1}^n b_k^t$ \nbe an equation,\nwhere $m, n, t, a_i, b_i$ are positive integers, and\n$a_i \\neq a_j$ for all $i, j$,\n$b_i \\neq b_j$ for all $i, j$,\n$a_i \\neq b_j$ for all $i, j$.\n\nDoes the equality have no solutions?\n\nFor $n \\neq m$, it is easy to find solutions for $t=2$ by Pythagorean theorem,\nand even for $n = m$, we have solutions like \n$1^2 + 4^2 + 6^2 + 7^2 = 2^2 + 3^2 + 5^2 + 8^2$.\nFor $t > 2$, similar equalities hold:\n$1^2 + 4^2 + 6^2 + 7^2 + 10^2 + 11^2 + 13^2 + 16^2 = 2^2 + 3^2 + 5^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 12^2 + 14^2 + 15^2$\nand \n$1^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 + 7^3 + 10^3 + 11^3 + 13^3 + 16^3 = 2^3 + 3^3 + 5^3 + 8^3 + 9^3 + 12^3 + 14^3 + 15^3$,\nand we can extend this trick to all $t > 2$.\n\nThe question is, if we introduce one more restriction, that is,\n  $|a_i - a_j| \\geq 2$ and $|b_i - b_j| \\geq 2$ for all $i, j$,\n  is it still possible to find solutions for the equation?\n\nFor $t = 2$ we can combine two Pythagorean triples, say,\n$5^2 + 12^2 + 25^2 = 7^2 + 13^2 + 24^2$,\nbut how about the cases for $t > 2$ and $n = m$?\n", "A": "For any $t$, if $m$ is sufficiently large relative to $t$, and $n$ is any positive integer (possibly equal to $m$), then the circle method proves that there exists an infinite sequence of increasingly large solutions such that the ratios between the $a_1,\\ldots,b_n$ approach any real positive ratios you want (assuming that a real solution with those ratios exists for that $m,n,t$).  This answers your question with much stronger inequalities than the ones you imposed.  If you want, you can simultaneously specify the residues of the $a_i$ and $b_j$ modulo some fixed number $N$, provided that those residues are compatible with the equation. In fact, again when $m \\gg t$, you can even fix the $b_j$ in advance: the solution to Waring's problem guarantees the existence of $a_1,\\ldots,a_m$, and a slight strengthening lets you impose your inequalities too, if the $b_j$ are large enough.

{"Q": "Pythagorean 5-tuples What is the solution of the equation $x^2+y^2+z^2+t^2=w^2$ in polynomials over C (\"Pythagorean 5-tuples\")? \nThere are simple formulas describing Pythagorean n-tuples for n=3,4,6:\n\n\n*\n\n*n=3. The formula for solutions of $x^2+y^2=z^2$ [4]:\n\n\n$x=d(p^2\u2212q^2)$,\n$y=2dpq$, \n$z=d(p^2+q^2),$\nwhere p,q,d are arbitrary polynomials. \n\n\n*\n\n*n=4. Similarly, all Pythagorean 4-tuples of polynomials are given by the identity [4, Theorem 2.2], [3, Theorem 7.1]:\n\n\n$(p^2+q^2-r^2-s^2)^2+(2pr+2qs)^2+(2ps-2qr)^2=(p^2+q^2+r^2+s^2)^2$\n\n\n*\n\n*n=6. The following identity produces Pythagorean 6-tuples [3, Theorem 7.2]:\n\n\n$(m^2-n^2)^2+(2mn)^2+(2(n_0m_1-m_1n_0+m_3n_2-m_2n_3))^2+$\n$(2(n_0m_2-m_2n_0+m_1n_3-m_3n_1))^2+$\n$(2(n_0m_3-m_3n_0+m_2n_1-m_1n_2))^2=(m^2+n^2)^2$\nwhere $m=(m_1,m_2,m_3,m_4)$, $n=(n_1,n_2,n_3,n_4)$, and $mn$ is the usual scalar product.\nThese identities are somehow related to sl(2,R), sl(2,C), sl(2,H), but the case n=5 is missing in this description [3, Theorems 7.1 and 7.2].  \nThe above formuli describe also Pythagorean n-tuples of integers. There are another descriptions of those; see [2] and [5, Chapter 5] for n<10, [6] for n<15, [1, Theorem 1 in Chapter 3] for arbitrary n, and also the answers below. \nThere are reasons to believe that Pythagorean 5-tuples cannot be described by a single polynomial identity. Thus identities producing a \"large\" set of solutions are also of interest, like \n$(-p^2+q^2+r^2+s^2)^2+(2pq)^2+(2pr)^2+(2ps)^2=(p^2+q^2+r^2+s^2)^2$\nThis identity does not give all solutions because it produces only reducible polynomials y,z,t (once p,q,r,s are nonconstant). Examples of solutions which cannot be obtained by the approaches in the answers below are also interesting.\nGiven a solution (x,y,z,t,w), methods to construct a new solution (x',y',z',t',w') are also of interest. For instance, \n$x'=w+y+z$,\n$y'=w+z+x$,\n$z'=w+x+y$,\n$t'=t$,\n$w'=2w+x+y+z$\n[see the answer of Ken Fan below for generalizations to other n] or\n$x'+iy'+jz'+kt'=q(x+iy+jz+kt)q$,\nwhere $q$ is arbitrary polynomial with quaternionic coefficients [see the answer of Geoff Robinson below].\n--\n[1] L.J.

{"Q": "Solutions to $\\binom{n}{5} = 2 \\binom{m}{5}$ In Finite Mathematics by Lial et al. (10th ed.), problem 8.3.34 says:\n\nOn National Public Radio, the Weekend Edition program posed the\n  following probability problem: Given a certain number of balls, of\n  which some are blue, pick 5 at random.  The probability that all 5 are\n  blue is 1/2.  Determine the original number of balls and decide how\n  many were blue.\n\nIf there are $n$ balls, of which $m$ are blue, then the probability that 5 randomly chosen balls are all blue is $\\binom{m}{5} / \\binom{n}{5}$.  We want this to be $1/2$,\nso $\\binom{n}{5} = 2\\binom{m}{5}$; equivalently,\n$n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)(n-4) = 2 m(m-1)(m-2)(m-3)(m-4)$.\nI'll denote these quantities as $[n]_5$ and $2 [m]_5$ (this is a notation for the so-called \"falling factorial.\")\nA little fooling around will show that $[m+1]_5 = \\frac{m+1}{m-4}[m]_5$.\nSolving $\\frac{m+1}{m-4} = 2$ shows that the only solution with $n = m + 1$ has $m = 9$, $n = 10$.\nIs this the only solution?\nYou can check that $n = m + 2$ doesn't yield any integer solutions, by using the quadratic formula to solve $(m + 2)(m  +1) = 2(m - 3)(m - 4)$.  For $n = m + 3$ or $n = m + 4$, I have done similar checks, and there are no integer solutions.  For $n \\geq m + 5$, solutions would satisfy a quintic equation, which of course has no general formula to find solutions.\nNote that, as $n$ gets bigger, the ratio of successive values of $\\binom{n}{5}$ gets smaller; $\\binom{n+1}{5} = \\frac{n+1}{n-4}\\binom{n}{5}$\nand $\\frac{n+1}{n-4}$ is less than 2\u2014in fact, it approaches 1. So it seems possible that, for some $k$, $\\binom{n+k}{5}$ could be $2 \\binom{n}{5}$.\nThis question was previously asked at Math StackExchange, without any answer, but some interesting comments were made. It was suggested that I ask here.\n", "A": "This isn\u2019t a complete answer, but the problem \u201creduces\u201d to finding the finitely many rational points on a certain genus 2 hyperelliptic curve. This is often possible by a technique\ninvolving a reduction to finding the rational points on a finite set of rank 0 elliptic curves\u2014see for example \u201cTowers of 2-covers of hyperelliptic curves\u201d by Bruin and Flynn in Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 357 (2005) #11 4329\u20134347.\nIn your case, the curve is $u^2= 9t^6+16t^5-200t^3+256t+144$. There are the following 16\nrational points: $(t,u)$ or $(t,-u)= (0,12)$, $(1,15)$, $(2,12)$, $(4,204)$, $(-1,9)$, $(-2,36)$, $(-4,180)$, and $(7/4,411/64)$. If these are the only rational points then the only non-trivial solution to your equation is $n=10$, $m=9$. To see this suppose that $$n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)(n-4)=2m(m-1)(m-2)(m-3)(m-4).$$ Let $$y=(n-2)^2\\text{ and }x=(m-2)^2.$$ Squaring both sides we find that $$y(y-1)(y-1)(y-4)(y-4)=4x(x-1)(x-1)(x-4)(x-4).$$ Suppose $y$ isn\u2019t $0$. Then $4x/y$ is $t^2$ for some rational $t$ with $$(y-1)(y-4)=t(x-1)(x-4).$$ We replace $y$ by $4x/t^2$ in this equation and find that $$(t^5-16)x^2-(5t^5-20t^2)x+(4t^5-4t^4)=0.$$ So this last quadratic polynomial in $x$ has a rational root and its\ndiscriminant is a square. This gives the hyperelliptic curve above. Note that the case $n=10$, $m=9$ of your problem corresponds to the point $(7/4,411/64)$ on this curve.\nEDIT:\nMore generally one can look for rational $m$ and $n$ with $[n]_5= 2[m]_5$. If $(t,u)$ is a\nrational point on the hyperelliptic curve with $t$ non-zero, set $x=(5t^5-20t^2+t^2u)/(2t^5-32)$ and $y=4x/t^2$. Then if $x$ is a square in $\\mathbb Q$, one gets such an $m$ and $n$ with $m=2+\\sqrt x$ and $n=2+\\sqrt y$.

For the cases when the zero blocks have not equal sizes, you obtain at least $4$ zero eigenvalues and the remaining eigenvalues can be obtain by quotient matrix of original matrix. Also, in each of those cases, you have at least some special induced subgraphs (such as $P_3$) which by interlacing theorem, you can analyze the behavior of eigenvalues of the original matrix.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://mathoverflow.net/questions/225251", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "3", "answer_count": 3, "answer_id": 2}}
