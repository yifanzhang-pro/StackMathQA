{"Q": "Positive integer solutions to the diophantine equation $(xz+1)(yz+1)=z^4+z^3 +z^2 +z+1$ Let $P(z) = z^4 +z^3 +z^2 +z+1$ where $z$ is a positive integer.\nWhile working with the diophantine equation $(xz+1)(yz+1)=P(z)$, I was able to construct a seemingly infinite and complete solution set to the diophantine equation in positive integers $(x, y, z)$.\nFirst,  define functions $r$ and $q$ of a positive integer $m$ as follows:\n\\begin{align} \nr(m) &= m^2+m-1 \\\\\nq(m) &= (r(m) +2)^2-2 \\\\\n\\end{align}\nAnd for a particular positive integer $m$, define sequences $A, B, C, D$ as follows;\n\\begin{align}\nA_1 &= m+1\\\\\nA_2 &= m^5 + 3m^4 + 5m^3 + 4m^2 +m\\\\\nA_n &= q(m)A_{n-1} - A_{n-2} - r(m)\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\begin{align}\nB_1 &=  m^3 + 2m^2 +2m\\\\\nB_2 &= q(m)B_1+r(m)\\\\\nB_n &= q(m)B_{n-1} - B_{n-2} + r(m) \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\begin{align}\nC_1 &=  m^3 + m^2 +m+1 \\\\\nC_2 &= q(m)C_1-r(m)\\\\\nC_n &= q(m)C_{n-1} - C_{n-2} - r(m)\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\begin{align}\nD_1 &=  m^5 + 2m^4 + 3m^3 + 3m^2 +m\\\\\nD_2 &= q(m)D_1+ r(m)- m\\\\\nD_n &= q(m)D_{n-1} - D_{n-2} + r(m) \\\\\n\\end{align}\nIt appears all positive integer solutions $(x,y,z)$ are given by $(A_n, A_{n+1} , B_n)$, $(C_n, C_{n+1}, D_n), n = 1, 2, \\dots $.\nHow does one go about proving that  $(A_n, A_{n+1} , B_n)$, $(C_n, C_{n+1}, D_n)$ are indeed solutions for all $n$ and showing that these are the only solutions? My approach would be to obtain closed formulae for $A_n, B_n, C_n$ and $ D_n$ then substitute into $(xz+1)(yz+1)=P(z)$ and check if the $LHS=RHS$. However, the closed forms of these sequences are too bulky. And also this method does not prove whether these are the only solutions.\nIf sequences $A, B, C, D $ cover all solutions in positive integers $x, y, z$ then it becomes much more efficient to determine if $P(z) $ possesses any proper factor of the form $xz+1$ for a  particular $z$ using these sequences as compared to trial divisions on $P(z) $ or prime factorizing $P(z) $.\nAlso, is it possible to construct all solutions for irreducible polynomials $P(z) = z^n+z^{n-1}+ \\cdots + z^2+z+1$ of degree $n>4?$\n", "A": "\"OP\" wants to know of a numerical solution which does not satisfy his parametric solution.

How to show that $x_k=\\Theta(1/\\sqrt{k})$?\n\nIt suffices to show that $x_k^{-2}=\\Theta(k)$. By Taylor expansion, we have\n$$x_{k+1}^{-2} = (y_k-\\eta y_k^3)^{-2} = y_k^{-2}(1-\\eta y_k^2)^{-2} = y_k^{-2}(1+2\\eta y_k^2+o(y_k^2)) = y_k^{-2}+2\\eta+o(1)$$\nIt seems that $x_{k+1}^{-2}$ and $y_k^{-2}$ form a linearly increases sequence.

So let's study $c_k:=\\frac{x_k-x_{k+1}}{x_k^3}$.
