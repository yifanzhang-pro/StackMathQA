{"Q": "Distance between the product of marginal distributions and the joint distribution Given a joint distribution $P(A,B,C)$, we can compute various marginal distributions. Now suppose:\n\\begin{align}\nP1(A,B,C) &= P(A) P(B) P(C)  \\\\\nP2(A,B,C) &= P(A,B) P(C)  \\\\\nP3(A,B,C) &= P(A,B,C)\n\\end{align}\nIs it true that $d(P1,P3) \\geq d(P2,P3)$ where d is the total variation distance?\nIn other words, is it provable that $P(A,B) P(C)$ is a better approximation of $P(A,B,C)$ than $P(A) P(B) P(C)$ in terms of the total variation distance? Intuitively I think it's true but could not find out a proof.\n", "A": "I just find the following counter-example. Suppose $A,B,C$ are discrete variables. $A,B$ can each take two values while $C$ can take three values. \nThe joint distribution $P(A,B,C)$ is:\n\\begin{array}{cccc}\nA & B & C & P(A,B,C) \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & 0.1/3 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 2 & 0.25/3 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 3 & 0.25/3 \\\\\n1 & 2 & 1 & 0.4/3 \\\\\n1 & 2 & 2 & 0.25/3 \\\\\n1 & 2 & 3 & 0.25/3 \\\\\n2 & 1 & 1 & 0.4/3 \\\\\n2 & 1 & 2 & 0.25/3 \\\\\n2 & 1 & 3 & 0.25/3 \\\\\n2 & 2 & 1 & 0.1/3 \\\\\n2 & 2 & 2 & 0.25/3 \\\\\n2 & 2 & 3 & 0.25/3 \\\\\n\\end{array}\nSo the marginal distribution $P(A,B)$ is:\n\\begin{array}{ccc}\nA & B & P(A,B) \\\\\n1 & 1 & 0.2 \\\\\n1 & 2 & 0.3 \\\\\n2 & 1 & 0.3 \\\\\n2 & 2 & 0.2 \\\\\n\\end{array}\nThe marginal distributions $P(A), P(B)$ and $P(C)$ are uniform.\nSo we can compute that:\n\\begin{align}\nd(P1,P3) &= 0.1 \\\\\nd(P2,P3) &= 0.4/3\n\\end{align}\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/65608", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "3", "answer_count": 1, "answer_id": 0}}
