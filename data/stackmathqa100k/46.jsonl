Limited computation for $m < 20000$ shows $m = 1, 5$. \nMany thanks, \nJianmin     \n", "A": "An elementary approach is enough here. If the given ratio is an integer, then any prime $p$ which divides $m^2 -2m+9$ divides either $m$ or $7m^2-22m+7$. If $p$ divides $m$ then clearly $p =3$. If $p$ divides $7m^2-22m+7$ then $p$ divides $$[7m^2-14m+63 - (7m^2-22m+7)] = 8m+56. $$\nHence either $p=2$ or $p$ divides $m+7.$ In the second case,\n$p$ divides $$(m^2-2m+9) -(m+7) = \nm^2-3m+2 = (m-1)(m-2).$$ Now $p$ divides $8$ if $m \\equiv 1$ (mod p) and\n$p$ divides $9$ if $m \\equiv 2$ (mod p). Hence $(m-1)^2 +8$ has the form\n$2^a 3^b$. The greatest common divisor of $7m^2 -22m+7$\nand $9m^2-2m+1$ is also very restricted. If $p$ is an odd prime which divides\nboth $7m^2-22m +7$ and $9m^2-2m+1$, then (subtracting the first from the second and dividing by $2$), $p$ divides $m^2 +10m-3$. Then (subtracting the first equation from $7$ times the new equation), $p$ divides $92m-28  = 4(23m-7)$ and hence $p$ divides $7m^2 +m = 7m^2-22m +7 + (23m-7).$ Since $p$ does not divide $m$, $p$ divides $7m+1$, and thus divides $(23m-7)-3(7m+1) = 2(m-5).$ But now  $p$ also divides $7(m-5) + 36$, so $p$ divides $36$ and $p=3$.\nHence we see that $m^2 -2m+9$  has the form $2^a 3^b$ and $9m^2 - 2m+1$ has the\nform $2^e 3^f$ for integers $a,b,e,f$. But now notice that the greatest common\ndivisor $d$ of $m^2 -2m+9$ and  $9m^2 - 2m+1$ divides $16m-80$, which is the latter equation minus 9 times the former. Also, $16$ does not divide $d$, since` $(m-1)^2 +8$ is not divisible by 16\n(and neither is $8m^2 +(m-1)^2$). If $h$ is the odd part of $d$, then $m \\equiv 5$ (mod h), and $h$ divides $24$. Hence $d$ divides $24$. If $m$ is divisible by $3$,  then $9m^2 - 2m+1$ must be a power of $2$, but is not divisible by $16$, yielding $m=0$ under current assumptions. Hence we may suppose that $m$ is not divisible by $3$. If $9$ divides $m^2-2m +9$, then $ m \\equiv 2 $ (mod 9) so $9m^2 - 2m+1 \\in \\{3,12,24\\}$, a contradiction. Hence $m^2-2m +9  = 24$  and $m= 5$\nor  $m^2-2m +9  = 8$  and $m= 1$ are the only remaining possibilities (for positive $m$ not divisible by 3, as we are currently assuming). Thus $m=1 $ and $m=5$ are the only positive integers which yield an integral value. (Later remark: Note that the additional solution $m=-1$ mentioned in the comment of Noam Elkies corresponds to the case $9m^2 - 2m+1 = 12 = m^2 -2m +9$, which does not occur for  positive $m$). \n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://mathoverflow.net/questions/66873", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "16", "answer_count": 3, "answer_id": 1}}

Let $c(g)$ be the minimum number of cubes such that the boundary of some configuration of $c(g)$ cubes is a genus $g$ surface.  Then $c(g)/g \\to 2$ as $g \\to \\infty$.  \nProof. We write $\\chi(X)$ for the compactly supported Euler characteristic\nof $X$, i.e., \n$\\chi(X) = \\sum (-1)^i \\dim H^i_c(X, \\mathbb{Q})$. \nNote this is not a homotopy invariant: the compactly supported Euler characteristic of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is $(-1)^n$.

Then $$\\chi(H_g) = 1-g.$$ \nOn the other hand, let $K$ be a configuration of cubes.  We write $K^0, K^1, K^2, K^3$ for the sets of vertices, edges, squares, and cubes, respectively, \nand $k^0, k^1, k^2, k^3$ for their cardinalities. Then \n$$\\chi(K) = k^0 - k^1 + k^2 - k^3$$\nWe will count $k^0, k^1, k^2, k^3$ by looking at the interior of the $2 \\times 2$ cube around each vertex.  That is, abutting some vertex $v$, there is $1$ vertex, $6$ edges, $12$ faces, and $8$ cubes.  More to the point, each $i$-dimensional face abuts $2^i$ vertices.  We write $K_v$ to mean the configuration localized at $v$; we write $K^i_v$ for the set of $i$-dimensional faces which abut the vertex $v$, and $k^i_v$ for its cardinality.  Thus: \n$$\\chi(K) = \\sum_{v \\in \\mathbb{Z}^3} \\sum_{i=0}^3 (-2)^{-i} \\cdot \nk^i_v $$ \nso we estimate\n$$\\frac{\\chi(K)}{k^3} = \\frac{\\sum_{v \\in \\mathbb{Z}^3} \\sum_{i=0}^3 (-2)^{-i} \\cdot k^i_v }{\\sum_{v \\in \\mathbb{Z}^3} 2^{-3} \\cdot  k^3_v } \\ge \n\\min_{v \\in \\mathbb{Z}^3} \\sum_i \\frac{(-2)^{-i} \\cdot k^i_v }{2^{-3} \\cdot k^3_v }$$\nThe above inequality comes from the following fact: a (weighted) average is greater than the minimum term being averaged.  Thus for any $a_i, b_i$ with $b_i > 0$, we have \n$$\\frac{\\sum_i a_i}{\\sum_i b_i} = \\sum_i \\frac{a_i}{b_i} \\cdot \\frac{b_i}{\\sum b_i}\n\\ge \\min_i \\frac{a_i}{b_i}$$\nNow let us analyze the possibilities for the right hand quantity\n$$\\tau(K_v) := \\frac{8}{k_v^3} \\cdot \\left(k_v^0 - \\frac{k_v^1}{2} + \\frac{k_v^2}{4} - \n\\frac{k_v^3}{8} \\right)  $$\nIn fact, in the $2\\times 2$ cube around a vertex, there are, up to symmetry, only 9 possible configurations of cubes whose boundary is (locally at that vertex) topologically a manifold: one each for every number of boxes other than 4, and for 4 boxes, the square, and the tripod configuration where, if say $v = (0,0,0)$, the cubes are the ones with most negative coordinates $(-1,-1,-1)$, $(-1, -1, 0)$, $(-1, 0, -1)$, and $(0, -1, -1)$.  Note that the neighborhood of every point in the interior of a very porous solid is a tripod configuration.\nIt remains to compute in each of these cases the above quantity.

It's not clear that this happens over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nHowever, one can find infinitely many solutions by finding genus $0$ curves on this surface.
