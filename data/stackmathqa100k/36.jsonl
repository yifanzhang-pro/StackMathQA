{"Q": "Does anyone know a polynomial whose lack of roots can't be proved? In Ebbinghaus-Flum-Thomas's Introduction to Mathematical Logic, the following  assertion is made:\nIf ZFC is consistent, then one can obtain a  polynomial $P(x_1, ..., x_n)$ which has no roots in the integers. However, this cannot be proved (within ZFC).\nSo if $P$ has no roots, then mathematics (=ZFC, for now) cannot prove it.\nThe justification is that Matiyasevich's solution to Hilbert's tenth problem allows one to turn statements about provable truths in a formal system to the existence of integer roots to polynomial equations.  The statement is \"ZFC is consistent,\" which cannot be proved within ZFC thanks to G\u00f6del's theorem.\nQuestion: Has such a polynomial ever been computed?\n(This arose in a comment thread on the beta site math.SE.)\n", "A": "For every consistent recursively axiomatizable theory $T$ there exists (and can be effectively computed from the axioms of $T$) an integer number $K$ such that the following Diophantine equation (where all letters except $K$ are variables) has no solutions over non-negative integers, but this fact cannot be proved in $T$:\n\\begin{align}&(elg^2 + \\alpha - bq^2)^2 + (q - b^{5^{60}})^2 + (\\lambda + q^4 - 1 - \\lambda b^5)^2 + \\\\\n&(\\theta + 2z - b^5)^2 + (u + t \\theta - l)^2 + (y + m \\theta - e)^2 + (n - q^{16})^2 + \\\\\n&[(g + eq^3 + lq^5 + (2(e - z \\lambda)(1 + g)^4 + \\lambda b^5 + \\lambda b^5 q^4)q^4)(n^2 - n) + \\\\\n&\\quad\\quad(q^3 - bl + l + \\theta \\lambda q^3 + (b^5-2)q^5)(n^2 - 1) - r]^2 + \\\\\n&(p - 2w s^2 r^2 n^2)^2 + (p^2 k^2 - k^2 + 1 - \\tau^2)^2 + \\\\\n&(4(c - ksn^2)^2 + \\eta - k^2)^2 + (r + 1 + hp - h - k)^2 + \\\\\n&(a - (wn^2 + 1)rsn^2)^2 + (2r + 1 + \\phi - c)^2 + \\\\\n&(bw + ca - 2c + 4\\alpha \\gamma - 5\\gamma - d)^2 + \\\\\n&((a^2 - 1)c^2 + 1 - d^2)^2 + ((a^2 - 1)i^2c^4 + 1 - f^2)^2 + \\\\\n&(((a + f^2(d^2 - a))^2 - 1) (2r + 1 + jc)^2 + 1 - (d + of)^2)^2 + \\\\\n&(((z+u+y)^2+u)^2 + y-K)^2 = 0.\n\\end{align}\nMoreover, for every such theory, the set of numbers with this property is infinite and not recursively enumerable.\nThe equation is derived from Undecidable Diophantine Equations, James P.

{"Q": "What is so special about $a^3+b^3+c^3 = (13m)^3$? It seems rather surprising that, given the Diophantine equation,\n$$a^3+b^3+c^3 = n^3\\tag1$$\nthen a good $\\color{red}{99.8\\%}$ of $n<1000000$ are solvable in positive integers $a,b,c$. (See the discussion in this MSE post.)\nOleg567 gave a list of the $1867$ unsolvable $n$ in that range. More than half were primes, while the divisibility by prime $p$ of the unsolvable composites are given by the table below. Oleg noticed a curious behavior:\n\\begin{array}{|l|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\np & \\mbox{# divisible  by } p & ...\\; p^2 & ...\\;p^3 \\\\\n\\hline\n2 & \\color{blue}{177} &  41 & 22\\\\\n3 & 31 &-&-\\\\\n5 & 53 &-&-\\\\\n7 & \\color{blue}{218} & 52 & 11 \\\\\n11 & 43 &-&-\\\\\n13 & \\color{blue}{300} & 46 & 4 \\\\\n17 & 47 &-&-\\\\\n23 & 31 &-&-\\\\\n31 & 34 &-&-\\\\\n37 & \\color{blue}{82} &-&-\\\\\n43 & 39 &-&-\\\\\n47 & 29 &-&-\\\\\n59 & 24 &1&-\\\\\n61 & 13 &-&-\\\\\n73 & 16 &-&-\\\\\n79 & 48 &4&-\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\nThus, in that range, there are just $31$ unsolvables of form,\n$$a^3+b^3+c^3 = (3m)^3$$\nbut $218$ unsolvables,\n$$a^3+b^3+c^3 = (7m)^3$$\nand $300$,\n$$a^3+b^3+c^3 = (13m)^3$$\n\nQ: What could explain this \"anomalous\" behavior of $p=2^k,7^k,13^k$ for $k=1,2,3$ with respect to the cubic Diophantine equation $(1)$?   \n\n", "A": "A solution of (1) must contain $0, 2$ or $4$ terms divisible by $13$.  Essentially, this is because the only cubic residues mod $13$ are $0, 1, 5, 8, 12$, and there is no combination (with or without repetition) of three of the non-zero residues with a sum $s$ such that $s \\equiv 0 \\pmod{13}$.  A proof is in (A).\nAlthough the same property applies to $2, 3$ and $7$, its effect on (1) for $13$, with $n^3 = (13m)^3$ is especially restrictive in the following sense.  If integers are randomly assigned to $a,b,c$ then the probability $P_0$ that none of them are divisible by $13$ is:\n$$P_0 = (12/13)^3 = 1728/2197$$\nThe probability $P_2$ that exactly two are divisible by $13$ is:\n$$P_2 = 3(1/13)^2(12/13) = 36/2197$$\nSo $1764/2197 \u2248 80\\%$ of random assignments fail to meet the above condition.  The corresponding percentages for $2, 3, 7$ are respectively $50\\%$, $52\\%$ and $68\\%$.\nThe much smaller number of cases for $3$ than for $2,7,13$ is partly explained by the fact that there are solutions of (1) with $n = 6,9$, which eliminates all cases other than those of the form $18k \\pm 3$, and in particular all of the form $3^2k$.\nReference\nA)  Bailey A (2009) Some Divisibility Properties of Cubic Quadruples, Mathematical Gazette 488 Nov 2009, Note 93.47; doi: 10.1017/S0025557200185262, jstor.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://mathoverflow.net/questions/286020", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "4", "answer_count": 1, "answer_id": 0}}

{"Q": "Is this combinatorial identity known? (of interest for random matrix theory) While playing around with random matrices and I arrived at a different formula for the mean of the limiting normal distribution for a spectral CLT for sample covariance matrices. More precisely I have the formula\n\\begin{align*}\n& \\sum\\limits_{b=1}^{r-1} c^{b} \\left(A(r,b) - {r \\choose b}^2 \\, b\\right)\n\\end{align*}\nfor the expression (1.23) from Bai and Silverstein's famous paper 'CLT for Linear Spectral Statistics of Large-Dimensional Sample Covariance Matrices', where\n\\begin{align*}\nA(r,b) :=& \\sum\\limits_{m=1}^{\\min(b,r-b+1)} (2m-1) {r \\choose b-m}{r \\choose b+m-1}\\\\\n& + \\sum\\limits_{m=1}^{\\min(b,r-b)} (2m+1) {r \\choose b-m}{r \\choose b+m} \\ .\n\\end{align*}\nIn order to show that my expression is equal to that of Bai and Silverstein, I need to show the equality\n$$\nA(r,b) = \\frac{1}{2} {2r \\choose 2b} + \\left( b - \\frac{1}{2} \\right) {r \\choose b}^2\n$$\nfor all $r \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and $b<r$. I am not too well versed with combinatorial identities and so far my efforts have lead nowhere. Does someone have an idea how to prove this?\nTesting with the computer shows this to be true for at least all $b<r \\leq 1000$.\nTechnically I could just use the fact that my formula and Bai and Silverstein's formula describe the same object to show this identity, which seems rather crude unless this identity is not jet known.\n", "A": "Firstly, exploit the finite support to simplify the limits of the sums. Secondly, split the second sum. We get\n$$\\begin{align*}A(r,b) =& \\sum\\limits_{m=1}^{r} (2m-1) {r \\choose b-m}{r \\choose b+m-1} \\\\\n& + \\sum\\limits_{m=1}^{r} 2m {r \\choose b-m}{r \\choose b+m} \\\\\n& + \\sum\\limits_{m=1}^{r} {r \\choose b-m}{r \\choose b+m}\n\\end{align*}$$\nThe first two are mechanical using Wilf-Zeilberger, so ask your favourite CAS (e.g. Wolfram Alpha or Sage) to get\n$$\\begin{align*}A(r,b) =\n& \\frac{b(r-b+1)\\binom{r}{b-1}\\binom{r}{b} + (b-2r-1)(b+r)\\binom{r}{b-r-1}\\binom{r}{b+r}}{r} \\\\\n& + \\frac{(b+1)(r-b+1)\\binom{r}{b-1}\\binom{r}{b+1} + (b-2r-1)(b+r+1)\\binom{r}{b-r-1}\\binom{r}{b+r+1}}{r} \\\\\n& + \\sum_{m=1}^r \\binom{r}{b-m} \\binom{r}{b+m}\n\\end{align*}$$\nFor the third sum, we apply $$\\sum_k \\binom{r}{m+k} \\binom{s}{n-k} = \\binom{r+s}{m+n}$$ (see e.g. identity (5.22) of Concrete Mathematics by Graham, Knuth and Patashnik). So $$\\sum_{m=1}^r \\binom{r}{b-m} \\binom{r}{b+m} = \\frac{\\sum_{m=-r}^r \\binom{r}{b-m} \\binom{r}{b+m} - \\binom{r}{b}^2}{2} = \\frac{\\binom{2r}{2b} - \\binom{r}{b}^2}{2}$$\nI've left you some cancellation, which I fully expect to be routine.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://mathoverflow.net/questions/426906", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "3", "answer_count": 1, "answer_id": 0}}
