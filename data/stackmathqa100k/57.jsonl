{"Q": "Euclidean volume of the unit ball of matrices under the matrix norm The matrix norm for an $n$-by-$n$ matrix $A$ is defined as $$|A| := \\max_{|x|=1} |Ax|$$ where the vector norm is the usual Euclidean one. This is also called the induced (matrix) norm, the operator norm, or the spectral norm. The unit ball of matrices under this norm can be considered as a subset of $\\Bbb R^{n^2}$. What is the Euclidean volume of this set? \nI'd be interested in the answer even in just the $2$-by-$2$ case.\n", "A": "I worked out the answer for the 2 by 2 case as well.\nFirst, when dealing with 2 by 2 matrices in general, a convenient variable change is:\n$$a\\rightarrow\\frac{w+x}{\\sqrt{2}},d\\rightarrow\\frac{w-x}{\\sqrt{2}},c\\rightarrow\\frac{y-z}{\\sqrt{2}},b\\rightarrow\\frac{y+z}{\\sqrt{2}}.$$\nThen $a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2 = w^2+x^2+y^2+z^2$.  And the determinant $(ad-bc) = \\frac{1}{2}(x^2+y^2-w^2-z^2)$.\n(Aside: this set of coordinates lets you see for instance that the set of rank 1 matrices in the space of 2D matrices realized as $\\mathbb{R}^4$ is a cone over the Clifford torus, since $x^2+y^2 = w^2+z^2$ on a sphere $x^2+y^2+w^2+z^2=r^2$ implies $x^2+y^2 = r^2/2$ and $w^2+z^2 = r^2/2$, which are scaled equations for a flat torus)\nLet $r_1^2 = x^2+y^2, r_2^2 = w^2+z^2$.  (These are radial coordinates of a coordinate system consisting of two orthogonal 2D cylindrical coordinate systems).  Then the norm squared is:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}\\left(r_1^2+r_2^2 + \\sqrt{ (r_1^2+r_2^2)^2 - (r_1^2-r_2^2)^2 }\\right)$$\nWhen this is less than one, this corresponds to the region plotted below:\n\nNote that each point in the $r_1,r_2$ picture corresponds to a different \"torus\", $x^2+y^2=r_1^2, w^2+z^2=r_2^2$.\nWe can now integrate over the shaded in region, $\\int_{region} dw dx dy dz$.\nThis 4-D integral can be reduced to 2D using $r_1$ and $r_2$, since $dx dy = 2\\pi r_1 dr_1, dw dz = 2\\pi r_2 dr_2$:\n$$(4\\pi^2) \\int_{region} dr_1 dr_2 r_1 r_2. $$\nNow, note that we can rewrite $r_2$ in terms of $r_1$.  In particular, after some manipulation of our norm, the shaded-in region is defined by $r_2^2 \\leq 2-2\\sqrt{2}r_1+r_1^2=(\\sqrt{2}-r_1)^2$.  Hence $r_2\\leq \\sqrt{2}-r_1$, and we can evaluate the $r_2$ integral:\n$$4\\pi^2 \\int_{r_1=0}^\\sqrt{2} dr_1 r_1 \\int_{r_2=0}^{\\sqrt{2}-r_1} r_2 dr_2 \\\\\n    = 4\\pi^2 \\int_{r_1=0}^\\sqrt{2} dr_1 r_1 (\\sqrt{2}-r_1)^2/2\\\\\n    = (4\\pi^2) (1/6).$$\nThis yields $2\\pi^2/3$, as Armin found.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://mathoverflow.net/questions/1464", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "24", "answer_count": 8, "answer_id": 5}}
{"Q": "A lower bound of a particular convex function Hello,\nI suspect this reduces to a homework problem, but I've been a bit hung up on it for the last few hours.  I'm trying to minimize the (convex) function $f(x) = 1/x + ax + bx^2$ , where $x,a,b>0$.  Specifically, I'm interested in the minimal objective function value as a function of $a$ and $b$.  Since finding the minimizer $x^*$ is tricky (requires solving a cubic), I figured I'd try and find a lower bound using the following argument:  if $b=0$, the minimizer is $x=1/\\sqrt{a}$ and the minimal value is $2\\sqrt{a}$.  If $a=0$, the minimizer is $x=(2b)^{-1/3}$ and the minimal value is $\\frac{3\\cdot2^{1/3}}{2}b^{1/3}$.  Therefore, one possible approximate solution is the convex combination\n$(\\frac{a}{a+b})\\cdot2\\sqrt{a} + (\\frac{b}{a+b})\\cdot\\frac{3\\cdot2^{1/3}}{2}b^{1/3}$.\nNumerical simulations suggest that the above expression is a lower bound for the minimal value.

{"Q": "Source and context of $\\frac{22}{7} - \\pi = \\int_0^1 (x-x^2)^4 dx/(1+x^2)$? Possibly the most striking proof of Archimedes's inequality $\\pi < 22/7$ is an integral formula for the difference:\n$$\n\\frac{22}{7} - \\pi = \\int_0^1 (x-x^2)^4 \\frac{dx}{1+x^2},\n$$\nwhere the integrand is manifestly positive.  This formula is \"well-known\" but its origin remains somewhat mysterious.  I ask:\n\nWho discovered this integral, and in what context?\n\nThe earliest reference I know of is Problem A-1 on the 29th Putnam Exam (1968).  According to J.H.McKay's report in the American Math. Monthly (Vol.76 (1969) #8, 909-915), the Questions Committee consisted of N.D.Kazarinoff, Leo Moser, and Albert Wilansky.  Is one of them the discoverer, and if so which one?\nThe printed solution, both in the Monthly article and in the book by Klosinski, Alexanderson, and Larson, says only \"The standard approach, from elementary calculus, applies. By division, rewrite the integrand as a polynomial plus a rational function with numerator of degree less than 2. The solution follows easily.\"  But surely there's more to be said, because this integral is a minor miracle of mathematics:\n$\\bullet$ Not only is the integrand manifestly positive, but it is always small: $x-x^2 \\in [0,1/4]$ for $x \\in [0,1]$, and the denominator $1+x^2$ is at least 1, so $(x-x^2)^4/(x^2+1) < 1/4^4 = 1/256$.  A better upper bound on the integral is $\\int_0^1 (x-x^2)^4 dx$, which comes to $1/630$ either by direct expansion or by recognizing the Beta integral $B(5,5)=4!^2/9!$.  Hence $\\frac{22}{7} - \\pi < 1/630$, which also yields Archimedes's lower bound $\\pi > 3\\frac{10}{71}$.\n$\\bullet$ The \"standard approach\" explains how to evaluate the integral, but not why the answer is so simple.  When we expand\n$$\n\\frac{(x-x^2)^4}{1+x^2} = x^6 - 4x^5 + 5x^4 - 4x^2 + 4 - \\frac4{x^2+1},\n$$\nthe coefficient of $x/(x^2+1)$ vanishes, so there's no $\\log 2$ term in the integral.  [This much I can understand: the numerator $(x-x^2)^4$ takes the same value $(1\\pm i)^4 = -4$ at both roots of the denominator $x^2+1$.]  When we integrate the polynomial part, we might\nexpect to combine fractions with denominators of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, obtaining a complicated rational number.  But only 7 appears: there's no $x$ or $x^3$ term; the $x^4$ coefficient 5 kills the denominator of 5; and the terms $-4x^5-4x^2$ might have contributed denominators of 6 and 3 combine to yield the integer $-2$.\nCompare this with the next such integrals\n$$\n\\int_0^1 (x-x^2)^6 \\frac{dx}{1+x^2} = \\frac{38429}{13860} - 4 \\log 2\n$$\nand\n$$\n\\int_0^1 (x-x^2)^8 \\frac{dx}{1+x^2} = 4\\pi - \\frac{188684}{15015},\n$$\nwhich yield better but much more complicated approximations to $\\log 2$ and $\\pi$...\nThis suggests a refinement of the \"in what context\" part of the question:\n\nDoes that integral for $(22/7)-\\pi$ generalize to give further approximations to $\\pi$ (or $\\log 2$ or similar constants) that are useful for the study of Diophantine properties of $\\pi$ (or $\\log 2$ etc.)?\n\n", "A": "This integral has a series counterpart\n$$\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{240}{(4k+5)(4k+6)(4k+7)(4k+9)(4k+10)(4k+11)}=\\frac{22}{7}-\\pi$$\nhttps://math.stackexchange.com/a/1657416/134791\n(UPDATE Peter Bala New series for old functions https://oeis.org/A002117/a002117.pdf, 2009, formula 5.1)\nEquivalently,\n$$\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{240}{(4k+1)(4k+2)(4k+3)(4k+5)(4k+6)(4k+7)}=\\frac{22}{7}-\\pi$$\nwhich may be seen as the first truncation of\n$$\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{240}{(4k+1)(4k+2)(4k+3)(4k+5)(4k+6)(4k+7)}=\\frac{10}{3}-\\pi$$\nTherefore, this series shows the following path to $\\frac{22}{7}$ \n$$\\frac{10}{3}-\\frac{240}{1\u00b72\u00b73\u00b75\u00b76\u00b77}=\\frac{10}{3}-\\frac{2\u00b75!}{\\frac{7!}{4}}=\\frac{10}{3}-\\frac{8\u00b75!}{5!6\u00b77}=\\frac{1}{3}\\left(10-\\frac{4}{7}\\right)=\\frac{1}{3}\u00b7\\frac{66}{7}=\\frac{22}{7}$$\nalso illustrating how only $7$ remains.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://mathoverflow.net/questions/67384", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "139", "answer_count": 6, "answer_id": 3}}
