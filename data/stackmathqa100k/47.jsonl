{"Q": "Deriving a relation in a group based on a presentation Suppose I have the group presentation $G=\\langle x,y\\ |\\ x^3=y^5=(yx)^2\\rangle$. Now, $G$ is isomorphic to $SL(2,5)$ (see my proof here).  This means the relation $x^6=1$ should hold in $G$.  I was wondering if anyone knows how to derive that simply from the group presentation (not using central extensions, etc.).  Even nicer would be an example of how software (GAP, Magma, Magnus, etc.) could automate that.\n", "A": "OK, here is the derivation, based completely on the amazing information provided by Victor Miller (who I should also thank for letting me know about kbmag).\nFirst, some identities:\n(1) From $x^3=xyxy$ we get: (a) $x^2=yxy$; (b) $xyx^{-1}=y^{-1}x$; (c) $x^{-1}yx=xy^{-1}$.\n(2) From $y^5=xyxy$ we get: (a) $y^4=xyx$; (b) $x^{-1}y^3=yxy^{-1}$; (c) $y^3x^{-1}=y^{-1}xy$.\n(3) From (1a) and (3b) we get $(yxy)(yxy^{-1})=(x^2)(x^{-1}y^3) = xy^3$; so $xy^2xy^{-1}=y^{-1}xy^3$.\n(4) From (2b) and (1b) we get $(yxy^{-1})(xyx^{-1}) = (x^{-1}y^3)(y^{-1}x) = x^{-1}y^2x$, so that $yxy^{-1}xy=x^{-1}y^2x^2$.\n(5) From (2c) we get $y^2x^{-1}y^{-1}=y^{-2}x$; squaring that yields $y(yx^{-1}yx^{-1})y^{-1}=y^{-2}xy^{-2}x$.  (1c), inverse, squared, shows this is the same as $yx^{-1}y^{-2}xy^{-1}=y^{-2}xy^{-2}x$.\n(6) Similar to (5).  From (2c) we get $y^2x^{-1}=y^{-2}xy$; squaring that yields $y^2x^{-1}y^2x^{-1}=y^{-1}(y^{-1}xy^{-1}x)y$.  (1b) squared shows this is the same as $y^2x^{-1}y^2x^{-1}=y^{-1}xy^2x^{-1}y$.\nOK, now consider the word $(y^{-1}xy^3)xy^{-1}xy$. From (3) this is $xy^2x(y^{-1}xy^{-1}x)y$, which from (1b) squared is $xy^2x(xy^2x^{-1})y=xy^2x^2y^2x^{-1}y$.\nThis word can also be written as $y^{-1}xy^2(yxy^{-1}xy)$, which from (4) is $y^{-1}xy^2(x^{-1}y^2x^2)$. So the previous two computations show\n$y^2x^2y^2xy^{-1}=x^{-1}(y^{-1}xy^2x^{-1}y)yx^2$\n$=x^{-1}y^2x^{-1}y^2(x^{-1}yx)x$ ...... from (6)\n$=x^{-1}y^2(x^{-1}y^2x)y^{-1}x$ ....... from (1c)\n$=(x^{-1}y^2x)y^{-1}xy^{-2}x$ ......... from (1c) squared\n$=xy^{-1}x(y^{-2}xy^{-2}x)$ ........... from (1c) squared\n$=xy^{-1}(xyx^{-1})y^{-2}xy^{-1}$ ..... from (5)\n$=x(y^{-2}xy^{-2}x)y^{-1}$ .............from (1b)\n$=(xyx^{-1})y^{-2}xy^{-2}$ ............ from (5)\n$=y^{-1}xy^{-2}xy^{-2}$ ............... from (1b).\nSo $y^2x^2y^2x^{-1}y=y^{-1}xy^{-2}xy^{-2}$, or $y^2x^2y^2=y^{-1}xy^{-2}xy^{-3}x$. But\n$y^{-1}xy^{-2}x(y^{-3}x)=y^{-1}xy^{-2}(xyx^{-1})y^{-1}=y^{-1}x(y^{-3}x)y^{-1}=y^{-1}(xyx^{-1})y^{-2}=y^{-2}xy^{-2}$ (through repeated application of (2b) inverse, and (1b)).\nThus $y^2x^2y^2=y^{-2}xy^{-2}$, or $y^4x^2y^4=x$, and from (2a) we get $xyx^4yx=x$, or $1=yx^4yx=(yxy)x^4=x^6$ (the second follows from $x^3$ being central and the third from (1a)).\nDone! \n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://mathoverflow.net/questions/15180", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "12", "answer_count": 4, "answer_id": 0}}

{"Q": "Is there an explicit expression for Chebyshev polynomials modulo $x^r-1$? This is an immediate successor of Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind and primality testing and does not have any other motivation - although original motivation seems to be huge since a positive answer (if not too complicated) would give a very efficient primality test (see the linked question for details).\nRecall that the Chebyshev polynomials $T_n(x)$ are defined by $T_0(x)=1$, $T_1(x)=x$ and $T_{n+1}(x)=2xT_n(x)-T_{n-1}(x)$, and there are several explicit expressions for their coefficients. Rather than writing them down (you can find them at the Wikipedia link anyway), let me just give a couple of examples:\n$$\nT_{15}(x)=-15x(1-4\\frac{7\\cdot8}{2\\cdot3}x^2+4^2\\frac{6\\cdot7\\cdot8\\cdot9}{2\\cdot3\\cdot4\\cdot5}x^4-4^3\\frac{8\\cdot9\\cdot10}{2\\cdot3\\cdot4}x^6+4^4\\frac{10\\cdot11}{2\\cdot3}x^8-4^5\\frac{12}{2}x^{10}+4^6x^{12})+4^7x^{15}\n$$\n$$\nT_{17}(x)=17x(1-4\\frac{8\\cdot9}{2\\cdot3}x^2+4^2\\frac{7\\cdot8\\cdot9\\cdot10}{2\\cdot3\\cdot4\\cdot5}x^4-4^3\\frac{8\\cdot9\\cdot10\\cdot11}{2\\cdot3\\cdot4\\cdot5}x^6+4^4\\frac{10\\cdot11\\cdot12}{2\\cdot3\\cdot4}x^8-4^5\\frac{12\\cdot13}{2\\cdot3}x^{10}+4^6\\frac{14}{2}x^{12}-4^7x^{14})+4^8x^{17}\n$$\nIt seems that $n$ is a prime if and only if all the ratios in the parentheses are integers; this is most likely well known and easy to show.\nThe algorithm described in the above question requires determining whether, for an odd $n$, coefficients of the remainder from dividing $T_n(x)-x^n$ by $x^r-1$, for some fairly small prime $r$ (roughly $\\sim\\log n$) are all divisible by $n$. In other words, denoting by $a_j$, $j=0,1,2,...$ the coefficients of $T_n(x)-x^n$, we have to find out whether the sum $s_j:=a_j+a_{j+r}+a_{j+2r}+...$ is divisible by $n$ for each $j=0,1,...,r-1$.\nThe question then is: given $r$ and $n$ as above ($n$ odd, $r$ a prime much smaller than $n$), is there an efficient method to find these sums $s_j$ without calculating all $a_j$? I. e., can one compute $T_n(x)$ modulo $x^r-1$ (i. e. in a ring where $x^r=1$) essentially easier than first computing the whole $T_n(x)$ and then dividing by $x^r-1$ in the ring of polynomials?\n(As already said, only the question of divisibility of the result by $n$ is required; also $r$ is explicitly given (it is the smallest prime with $n$ not $\\pm1$ modulo $r$).
