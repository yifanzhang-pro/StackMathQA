{"Q": "Derivation of Total Momentum Operator for Klein-Gordon Field Quantization I am studying the second chapter of Peskin and Schroeder's QFT text. In equation 2.27 and 2.28, the book defines the field operators:\n$$\n\\phi(x) = \\int \\frac{d^3p}{(2\\pi)^3} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 w_p}} (a_p + a^\\dagger_{-p}) \\, e^{ipx} \\\\\n\\pi(x) = \\int \\frac{d^3p}{(2\\pi)^3} (-i) \\sqrt{\\frac{w_p}{2}} (a_p - a^\\dagger_{-p}) \\, e^{ipx}\n$$\nThe momentum operator is then calculated in equation 2.33. However, my own derivation gives a different answer. I am reproducing my steps hoping that someone will be able to find where I went wrong. Starting with the definition of the momentum (conserved charge of spatial translations):\n$$\n\\mathbf{P} = -\\int d^3x \\, \\pi(x) \\nabla \\phi(x) \\\\\n\\mathbf{P} = -\\int d^3x \\, \\Bigg[ \\int \\frac{d^3p}{(2\\pi)^3} (-i) \\sqrt{\\frac{w_p}{2}} (a_p - a^\\dagger_{-p}) \\, e^{ipx} \\Bigg]\\Bigg[\\int \\frac{d^3p'}{(2\\pi)^3} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 w_{p'}}} (a_{p'} + a^\\dagger_{-p'}) \\, \\nabla e^{ip'x} \\Bigg] \\\\\n\\mathbf{P} = -\\int \\int  \\frac{d^3p}{(2\\pi)^3} \\frac{d^3p'}{(2\\pi)^3} \\int d^3x \\, (-i^2) \\, \\mathbf{p}' \\, e^{i(p+p')x}  \\, \\Bigg[\\sqrt{\\frac{w_p}{2}} (a_p - a^\\dagger_{-p}) \\, \\Bigg]\\Bigg[\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 w_{p'}}} (a_{p'} + a^\\dagger_{-p'}) \\Bigg] \\\\\n\\mathbf{P} = -\\int \\int  \\frac{d^3p}{(2\\pi)^3} \\frac{d^3p'}{(2\\pi)^3} \\mathbf{p}' (2\\pi)^3 \\delta(p+p')  \\, \\sqrt{\\frac{w_p}{2}} (a_p - a^\\dagger_{-p}) \\, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 w_{p'}}} (a_{p'} + a^\\dagger_{-p'}) \\\\\n\\mathbf{P} = -\\int \\int  \\frac{d^3p}{(2\\pi)^3} (-\\mathbf{p}) \\sqrt{\\frac{w_p}{2}} (a_p - a^\\dagger_{-p}) \\, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 w_{-p}}} (a_{-p} + a^\\dagger_{p}) \\\\\n$$\nSince $w_{p} = w_{-p} = |p|^2 + m^2$, we get\n$$\n\\mathbf{P} = -\\int \\frac{d^3p}{2(2\\pi)^3} (-\\mathbf{p}) \\sqrt{\\frac{w_p}{w_{p}}} (a_p - a^\\dagger_{-p}) (a_{-p} + a^\\dagger_{p}) \\\\\n\\mathbf{P} = \\int \\frac{d^3p}{(2\\pi)^3} \\frac{\\mathbf{p}}{2} (a_p - a^\\dagger_{-p}) (a_{-p} + a^\\dagger_{p}) \\\\\n\\mathbf{P} = \\int \\frac{d^3p}{(2\\pi)^3} \\frac{\\mathbf{p}}{2} \\bigg[ a_p a_{-p} + a_p a^\\dagger_{p} -a^\\dagger_{-p} a_{-p} - a^\\dagger_{-p} a^\\dagger_{p} \\bigg] \\\\\n\\mathbf{P} = \\int \\frac{d^3p}{(2\\pi)^3} \\frac{\\mathbf{p}}{2} \\bigg[ a_p a_{-p} - a^\\dagger_{-p} a^\\dagger_{p} \\bigg] + \\int \\frac{d^3p}{(2\\pi)^3} \\frac{\\mathbf{p}}{2} \\bigg[ a_p a^\\dagger_{p} -a^\\dagger_{-p} a_{-p}\\bigg] \\\\\n$$\nThe first integral is odd with respect to p, and vanishes. For the second term, we can formally prove that $a^\\dagger_{-p} a_{-p} = a^\\dagger_{p} a_{p}$, but we can also argue that from noting that this operator pair creates a particle but then destroys it, with any possible constants only depending on the magnitude of \\mathbf{p}.
