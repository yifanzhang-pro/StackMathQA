{"Q": "Calculating the amount of work done to assemble a net charge on a sphere I've been reviewing electrostatics using an old exam and I stumbled upon this question:\n\nCalculate the amount of work required to assemble a net charge of $+Q$ on a spherical conductor of radius $R$. If an additional charge of $-Q$ were to be assembled on a concentric spherical conductor of radius $R+a$,what amount of work would the entire process require?\n\nNow the first part is not that difficult, we just do:\n$$\\vec E = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0 R^2} \\hat r \\, \\text{(From Gauss's Law)}$$\n$$\\begin{align}\nW & = \\frac{\\epsilon_0}{2} \\int E^2 \\, d\\tau \\\\ \n  & = \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon_0}{2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{Q^2}{(4 \\pi \\epsilon_0)^2}\\right) \\int d \\Omega \\int_R^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{R'^{4}} R'^{2} dR'\\\\\n  & = \\frac{4\\pi Q^2}{32 \\pi^2 \\epsilon_0} \\frac{1}{R} \\\\\n  &= \\frac{Q^2}{8 \\pi \\epsilon_0 R} \\\\\n\\end{align}$$\nBut for the second part, according to a solution that a friend of mine gave me, only thing that we need to do to calculate the total work is to do:\n$$\\begin{align} W_{tot} & = \\frac{\\epsilon_0}{2} \\int E^2 d \\tau \\\\\n  & = \\frac{4 \\pi Q^2}{32 \\pi^2 \\epsilon_0} \\int_R^{R+a} \\frac{1}{R'^2} dR' \\\\\n  & = \\frac{Q^2}{8 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\left(\\frac{1}{R} - \\frac{1}{R+a}\\right) \\\\\n\\end{align}$$\nBut according to equation $(2.47)$ of Griffiths, total work should be equal to:\n$$\\begin{align}\nW_{tot} & = \\frac{\\epsilon_0}{2} \\int (E_1+E_2)^2 d\\tau \\\\\n& = \\frac{epsilon_0}{2} \\int (E_1^2 + E_2^2 + 2E_1 \\cdot E_2) d\\tau \\\\\n& = W_1 + W_2 + \\epsilon_0 \\int E_1 \\cdot E_2 d \\tau \\\\\n\\end{align}$$\nWherein for this case $W_1$ is the work required for a sphere of radius $R$ as shown earlier, and $W_2$ is the work required for a sphere of radius $R+a$. Is the first method correct?\n", "A": "Answer:The two methods are both correct.\nAs I have suggested in the comment area, total work calculated by using the first method should be \n$$W_{tot}=\\frac{Q^2}{8\\pi\\epsilon_0}(\\frac{1}{R}-\\frac{1}{R+a}),\n$$ \nsince $\\int \\frac{1}{r^2}dr=-\\frac{1}{r}+\\text{Constant}$.\nNext we will calculate the total work by the second method, i.e. the equation $(2.47)$ of Griffiths. As indicated in the problem, we have\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathbf{E}_1 & =\\frac 1 {4\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\frac{Q}{r^2}\\hat{\\mathbf{r}},\\ \\text{while}\\ r\\ge R\\\\\n\\mathbf{E}_2 & =-\\frac 1 {4\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\frac{Q}{r^2}\\hat{\\mathbf{r}},\\ \\text{while}\\ r\\ge R+a\n\\end{align}\nSo, \n\\begin{align}\nE_1^2 & =\\frac{Q^2}{16\\pi^2\\epsilon_0^2r^4}\\\\\nE_2^2 & =\\frac{Q^2}{16\\pi^2\\epsilon_0^2r^4}\\\\\nE_1\\cdot E_2 & =-\\frac{Q^2}{16\\pi^2\\epsilon_0^2r^4}\n\\end{align}\nAnd\n\\begin{align}\nW_1 & =\\frac{\\epsilon_0}{2}\\int E_1^2d\\tau\\\\\n    & =\\frac{Q^2}{8\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\int_R^\\infty\\frac{1}{r^2}dr\\\\\n    & =\\frac{Q^2}{8\\pi\\epsilon_0R}\n\\end{align}\nBy using same method, we get $W_2$ as foolow,\n$$\nW_2=\\frac{Q^2}{8\\pi\\epsilon_0(R+a)}\n$$\nFinally, the cross term is that\n\\begin{align}\n\\epsilon_0 \\int \\mathbf{E}_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{E}_2 d\\tau & =-\\frac{Q^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\int_{R+a}^\\infty \\frac{1}{r^2}dr\\\\ \n& =-\\frac{Q^2}{8\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\frac{2}{R+a}\n\\end{align}\nThen we add them all up, we have,\n\\begin{align}\nW_{tot} & =W_1+W_2+\\epsilon_0\\int \\mathbf{E}_1\\cdot\\mathbf{E}_2d\\tau \\\\\n& =\\frac{Q^2}{8\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\frac{1}{R}+\\frac{Q^2}{8\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\frac{1}{R+a}-\\frac{Q^2}{8\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\frac{2}{R+a}\\\\\n& =\\frac{Q^2}{8\\pi\\epsilon_0}(\\frac{1}{R}-\\frac{1}{R+a})\n\\end{align}\nConclusion: The results are the same by two methods.In the first method, when we wrote the formula of $W_{tot}$, the electric field $E$ is the final field after used superposition princeple. In the second, we also used superposition princeple, but we wrote it in the form of $W$ explicitly. I mean that the two methods are the same, but have different forms.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/226456", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "3", "answer_count": 1, "answer_id": 0}}
