By the way, since $1+2^a+3^a$ is even, $(1+2^a+3^a)^b$ is a multiple of $8$. Since $2^c$ is a multiple of $8$, this leads that $3^c+1$ is a multiple of $8$, which is a contradiction.

Otherwise we can write it as $n = a \\cdot b$ with $1 < a \\leq b$ and partition $b$ into $k$ parts in two different ways, then multiply them by $a$ to get two different partitions of $n$ with the property.\nNow suppose $n = 6 \\cdot m + 35$.  A sufficiently large $m$ has two different partitions into $k - 1$ parts such that each part of each partition is divisible by either $5$ or $7$.

The same logic above applies, and that covers all the cases.  Filling in some more details results in a simple formula for an upper bound in terms of $k$: the first part says if $n$ is composite then $n \\lt (k+2)^2$, and the second part chases down the primes relatively more quickly placing the largest one in $6 \\cdot k + O(1)$.\nMore generally still, we can require that the pairwise $\\text{gcd}$ of the parts be greater than or equal to some $d \\ge 2$ (so the question of $47$ corresponds to the case $d = 2$ and $k = 5$).  An effective upper bound on unique solutions can still be obtained: we just have to carry out the above argument for all congruence classes mod $d$, in each case representing the remainder as a semiprime with prime factors larger than $d$.\nEDIT: That led me to the following even simpler version, working mod $2$ instead of mod $6$: if $m$ has two different partitions into $5$ parts, then $n = 2 \\cdot m$ has two different partitions into $5$ parts, no two parts of which are relatively prime.

{"Q": "Can each natural number be represented by $2w^2+x^2+y^2+z^2+xyz$ with $x,y,z\\in\\mathbb N$? It is well known that each $n\\in\\mathbb N=\\{0,1,2,\\ldots\\}$ can be written as $2w^2+x^2+y^2+z^2$ with $w,x,y,z\\in\\mathbb N$. Furthermore,\n$$\\{2w^2+x^2+y^2:\\ w,x,y\\in\\mathbb N\\}=\\mathbb N\\setminus\\{4^k(16m+14):\\ k,m\\in\\mathbb N\\}.$$\nMotivated by this, here I pose the following novel question.\nQuestion 1.

Your comments are welcome!\n", "A": "The answer to question 1 is yes - the other questions seem to me to be more difficult.\nIf $n$ is odd, then there are non-negative integers $w$, $x$ and $y$ so that $n = 2w^{2} + x^{2} + y^{2}$. One way to see this is that the class number of this quadratic form $Q_{1} = 2w^{2} + x^{2} + y^{2}$ is $1$, and so every locally represented integer is represented. The only local obstructions are at $2$, and this implies that every integer not of the form $14 \\cdot 4^{k} \\pmod{4^{k+2}}$ for $k \\geq 0$ is represented by $Q_{1}$.\nIf $n$ is even, then there are non-negative integers $w$, $x$ and $y$ so that $n = 2w^{2} + x^{2} + xy + y^{2} + 1$. The quadratic form $Q_{2} = 2w^{2} + x^{2} + xy + y^{2}$ also has class number $1$, and it represents all integers not of the form $10 \\cdot 4^{k} \\pmod{4^{k+2}}$ for some $k \\geq 0$. In particular, $Q_{2}$ represents every odd number and so every even $n$ can be written in the form $2w^{2} + x^{2} + xy + y^{2} + 1$.\nNote that if $m \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and $m = x^{2} + xy + y^{2}$ for some $x, y \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, then there are $x'$ and $y'$ in $\\mathbb{N}$ so that $m = (x')^{2} + (x')(y') + (y')^{2}$. This can be seen by applying one of the six automorphisms of the quadratic form $x^{2}+xy+y^{2}$.\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://mathoverflow.net/questions/416344", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "2", "answer_count": 1, "answer_id": 0}}
{"Q": "Do roots of these polynomials approach the negative of the Euler-Mascheroni constant? Let $p_n$ be the $n$th degree polynomial that sends $\\frac{k(k-1)}{2}$ to $\\frac{k(k+1)}{2}$ for $k=1,2,...,n+1$. E.g., $p_2(x) = (6+13x -x^2)/6$ is the unique quadratic polynomial $p(x)$ satisfying $p(0) = 1$, $p(1) = 3$, and $p(3) = 6$. Then it appears that $p_n(x)-x$ always has precisely one negative real root, and moreover this root (as a function of $n$) appears to approach $-0.577$ as $n$ gets large. Do these roots indeed approach a limit, and is this limit indeed the negative of the Euler-Mascheroni constant?\nFor $n=60$, the root is about $-0.580$; for $n=120$, the root is about $-0.577$. That's as far as I've gone.\n(If the question seems unmotivated, I'll give some background, though it might not help anyone find an answer. One way to think about the \"values\" of certain divergent series is to view them as fixed points of an associated function; e.g., for the series $1+2+4+8+\\dots$, the linear map $x \\mapsto 2x+1$ sends the sum of the first $n$ terms of the series to the sum of the first $n+1$ terms, and the fixed point of this map is $-1$, which is indeed the natural value to assign to the divergent series.
