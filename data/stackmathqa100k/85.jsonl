{"Q": "Distribution of $\\sqrt{X^2+Y^2}$ when $X,Y$ are independent $U(0,1)$ variables \nAs a routine exercise, I am trying to find the distribution of $\\sqrt{X^2+Y^2}$ where  $X$ and $Y$ are independent $ U(0,1)$ random variables.\n\nThe joint density of $(X,Y)$ is  $$f_{X,Y}(x,y)=\\mathbf 1_{0<x,y<1}$$\nTransforming to polar coordinates $(X,Y)\\to(Z,\\Theta)$ such that $$X=Z\\cos\\Theta\\qquad\\text{ and }\\qquad Y=Z\\sin\\Theta$$ \nSo, $z=\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ and $0< x,y<1\\implies0< z<\\sqrt 2$.\nWhen $0< z<1$, we have $0< \\cos\\theta<1,\\,0<\\sin\\theta<1$ so that $0<\\theta<\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\nWhen $1< z<\\sqrt 2$, we have $z\\cos\\theta<\\implies\\theta>\\cos^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{z}\\right)$, as $\\cos\\theta$ is decreasing on $\\theta\\in\\left[0,\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right]$; and $z\\sin\\theta<1\\implies\\theta<\\sin^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{z}\\right)$, as $\\sin\\theta$ is increasing on $\\theta\\in\\left[0,\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right]$.\nSo, for $1< z<\\sqrt 2$, we have $\\cos^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{z}\\right)<\\theta<\\sin^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{z}\\right)$.\nThe absolute value of jacobian of transformation is $$|J|=z$$\nThus the joint density of $(Z,\\Theta)$ is given by \n$$f_{Z,\\Theta}(z,\\theta)=z\\mathbf 1_{\\{z\\in(0,1),\\,\\theta\\in\\left(0,\\pi/2\\right)\\}\\bigcup\\{z\\in(1,\\sqrt2),\\,\\theta\\in\\left(\\cos^{-1}\\left(1/z\\right),\\sin^{-1}\\left(1/z\\right)\\right)\\}}$$\nIntegrating out $\\theta$, we obtain the pdf of $Z$ as\n$$f_Z(z)=\\frac{\\pi z}{2}\\mathbf 1_{0<z<1}+\\left(\\frac{\\pi z}{2}-2z\\cos^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{z}\\right)\\right)\\mathbf 1_{1<z<\\sqrt 2}$$\n\nIs my reasoning above correct?

Not exactly sure which part of my logic is incorrect.\n", "A": "Let's find a formula that will apply to both your situations.\nOne description that covers them both supposes $X$ is a uniform random variable defined on an arithmetic progression\n$$x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n = a, a+d, a+2d,\\ldots, a+(n-1)d = b.$$\nThus $x_i=a+(i-1)d$ and each $x_i$ has a probability $1/n.$  By definition\n$$E[X] = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\Pr(x_i)x_i = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{1}{n}\\, (a+(i-1)d) = \\frac{2a+(n-1)d}{2} = \\frac{a+b}{2}.$$\nThen, also by definition,\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\operatorname{Var}(X) &= E[(X-E[X])^2] = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\Pr(x_i)(x_i-E[X])^2 \\\\\n&= \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{1}{n}\\, \\left(a + (i-1)d - \\frac{2a+(n-1)d}{2}\\right)^2\\\\\n&=d^2\\frac{n^2-1}{12}.\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nThe factor of $d^2$ is precisely what you expected from the scaling law for the variance.

But in terms of $a,$ $n,$ and $d,$ this is\n$$\\frac{(b-a+1)^2-1}{12} = \\frac{(a+(n-1)d - a + 1)^2-1}{12} = \\frac{(d(n-1)+1)^2}{12}$$\nwhich gives the correct value only when $d=0$ or $d=1.$ Your formula does not apply to any other situation.  That's why we needed to work out the generalization.\nFinally, if you would prefer a formula in terms of the two endpoints $a$ and $b$ and the count $n\\gt 1,$ you can recover $d$ as\n$$d = \\frac{b-a}{n-1}$$\nand plug that in to get\n\n$$\\operatorname{Var}(X) = \\left(\\frac{b-a}{n-1}\\right)^2 \\frac{n^2-1}{12} = \\frac{(b-a)^2}{12}\\,\\frac{n^2-1}{(n-1)^2}.$$\n\nThis is informative, because for medium to large $n,$ the second fraction is close to $1$ (the error is on the order of $1/n$) and can be ignored.  What is left is the variance of the variable uniformly distributed over all numbers between $a$ and $b.$  The quadratic dependence on the scale is explicit in the factor $(b-a)^2.$\n", "meta": {"language": "en", "url": "https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/504425", "timestamp": "2023-03-29", "source": "stackexchange", "question_score": "3", "answer_count": 1, "answer_id": 0}}
